135,humira adalimumab for rheumatoid arthritis,3.0,"I had sudden onset acute rheumatoid arthritis at age 58. Severe pain, swelling, unable to work or do much of anything. Rheumatologist put me on Humira after trying various other therapies. Was taking Methotrexate, but that started causing chest pain. The Humira was like magic for a while - the pain was much diminished. I was able to go back to work and resume very active lifestyle. After about 1 1/2 years, the side effects started. Rash at first, then a plaque-like rash with sloughing skin (which is still spreading) on my head, hands. Then boils started - very large, very slow to heal. I have to stop taking it - it is killing my immune system. Really not sure how much damage has been done to my body from this drug. There are significant risks to this drug.",significant risk drug.,humira,adalimumab,rheumatoid arthritis,NEGATIVE,0.8902033567428589

When I didn't care about diet I felt extreme effects of a headache and pain in the stomach. Noticed that if I eat a lot of food that day my effects aren't bad. Watch your diet !! With Humira the first few months I noticed pain went away. Was so happy, now I think that it isn't helping anymore. Feet still ache because of cold weather but the first few months I had no pain. I read reviews and the mention of tinnitus comes a lot. I thought ears may ring/hum because wearing earbuds but starting to believe that it may be caused by Humira. My doc told me I may need to take another med or Humira every week.

I can actually function and get out of bed pain free every morning. BUT after starting it, I now have very scaly, dry skin on my face. It is along my jawline, beside my ears, eyelids, sometimes my forehead, and my upper arms. But the biggest issue is that since starting it, I have not ovulated now for 3 cycles whereas before this, my cycles were like clockwork. One of the main reasons I started this medication was so that I could get off of Methotrexate and start trying to conceive. My doctor put me on it and then has been off because of an injury since and I haven't even had the opportunity to talk to her about what's going on. The nurse that I have with the Cimzia support group doesn't know much.

I think that the drug Simponi is very dangerous to take and she still can't walk after 2 years after stopping the drug.  She has to take infusions of IVIG  gamma globulin every third week to rebuild her nerves after the erosion of the myelin of the nerves took place.  This is a very serious side effect that no one has addressed.  I am sure that others have had this side effect hit them from taking Simponi.  We have spent over $200,000 in medical expenses toward my wife's recovery and will take at lease 1 to 2 more years for her to recover.","spent $200,000 medical expense toward wife's recovery take lease 1 2 year recover.",simponi,golimumab,rheumatoid arthritis,NEGATIVE,0.9920365810394287

I think it's working very well so far.....I have taken many other  types of medicines over 7 years with  big side effects for RA.
I have had Ulcerative Colitis  for 15 years and took some meds for that. Because of side effects I began a very stringent diet, (specific carbohydrate diet).
I eventually got better and all UC symptoms stopped. Years later went off the diet and was soon reduced to suffering immensely with undiagnosed  RA symptoms.
I believe  my diet  contributes to my symptoms. I know food chemicals  can cause inflammation  and I know UC is cousin to RA.

From my first shot to the sixth the shot I just received this month the Simponi removed my symptons of AS to the point where I feel normal.  Before being diagnosed and receiving Simponi I was in pain constantly and taking meds that were basically for gout which what I was being treated for before my diagnosis for AS. One month the doc tried Remicade but it was ineffective for me.  The Simponi has given me back normality at least in the sense of physical well-being.

I've tried everything from PUVA, steroids, coal tar, Methotrexate, Enbrel, Humira & more.  I've had success with the biologics, but got very ill with sinus infections on both Enbrel and Humira (so bad that I got vertigo and had to go to hospital via ambulance). I took 2 years off and now just started Stelara (had my ""booster"" second shot yesterday).  My dermatologist is shocked how I've cleared already!  This is a miracle and any person out there who can take it, should.  I'm also sleeping so much better during the night-- not scratching in my sleep!

My last med Otezla didn't work for me and made things much worse. I had my first Stelara injection on May 7 2016. After about 10 days I could feel an improvement. After 4 weeks there was a dramatic improvement and I was almost clear.  It is 9 weeks since my second injection and my life has changed in so many ways for the better thanks to this medicine.  There is a slight redness where some of the patches were but the dermatologist assures me these will fade. I have no side affects whatsoever.

I received my second Stellar injection about one month ago, an phased out the cyclosporine one week ago. The skin is incredibly clear of spots (since 25 years it has not been this good), but as a change, an almost intolerable itching started. 

a) Would anyone have experience how to calm down the itching? 

Taking sodium bicarbonate with water seems to help a bit, but I am still scratching in my sleep.  I have allergies, and thought that maybe antihistamine could work.

I received my second Stellar injection about one month ago, an phased out the cyclosporine one week ago. The skin is incredibly clear of spots (since 25 years it has not been this good), but as a change, an almost intolerable itching started. 

a) Would anyone have experience how to calm down the itching? 

Taking sodium bicarbonate with water seems to help a bit, but I am still scratching in my sleep.  I have allergies, and thought that maybe antihistamine could work.

I have been on Tysabri for 6 years. Tysabri has quite literally saved my life. My peripheral vision is gone due to prior MS flares, but my flares are non-existent now. Since I have been on the drug so long my greatest side effect of infusion seems to be fatigue for a day or 2 after infusion. During infusion I am also given IV Benadryl & anti-nausea medication. 
My MRI's have come back clean...no demyelination. If previous MRI's and spinal taps did not show positive proof of disease I would like to believe I was cured.

My last MRI showed that some of my lesions actually got smaller, and I have not had any brain atrophy whilst being on this drug. The only side effect I notice is slightly thinner hair. This is a drug that can have serious implications, and I think the choice to take it must be thought carefully, weighing all the benefits and risks.
