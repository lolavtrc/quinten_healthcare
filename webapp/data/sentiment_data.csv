0,Inflectra infliximab for Crohns Disease,1.0,"Insurance forced me to switch to inflectra due to being cheaper for THEM for my Crohn's. I did not have a say, and insurance won't listen to Dr. recommendations. While on Treatment I only had flare ups 3 days a month during my period,  but no other issues or side effects. Yet after only 2 infusions on Treatment I have multiple daily loose stools regardless of healthy diet, as well as bloody stools at least once a day.  In addition to Treatment not preventing flare ups, inflammation, and symptoms; Treatment has incurred more issues that I didn't have previously:
Kidney pain
Rib Pain
Joint pain: shoulders,  wrists,  ankles.
Nausea
Headaches
Severe Fatigue 
Charlie horse cramping in my hands, where I can't move my thumb; it's completely contracted.

She was in Japan and started on remicade in Apr 2007 and die in Feb 2008 from the reactions/side effect to it. I advise that if you get any of the side effect symptoms to see your doctor right away.

2,Remicade infliximab for Ulcerative Colitis,1.0,"This medication Treatment made me in constant pain. I slept for two months 20 hours a day. I felt very depressed. My body was in pain everywhere and I was covered in a rash. Parts of my body have permanent nerve damage months after I got off it. My specialist told me it is hard to diagnose nerve damage, as if that matters. Is everyone a liar till a doctor proves it? This same specialists wanted me to go back on it. I said I really didn't want to go through that again. The specialist would not leave it alone. I Mentioned Covid-19 to him and he said it won't make a difference if I am off remicade or not. Oh okay, I guess all these tests were for nothing then? Now I am without a specialist. He then talked down about me to my family doctor saying I am refusing treatment. Now my family doctor is treating me like I am just wasting people's time. I suspect this is exactly how people become homeless. Do I have no rights?

Years of my life, my career, independence & ability to have biological children lost but Treatment saved my life. I've been in Remission since early 2018-.Trough levels in high 20's.
At JUST that time, my insurance made mandatory switch: ALL patients on Treatment to Treatment. Since that time, trough levels have steadily dropped to where I'm near rejection & TERRIFIED to start developing abscesses & fistulas again- I'd rather die. Seriously.
I'm now writing to Medicare Commissioner who's probably some paper pusher w/o any IBD training to SAVE MY LIFE & give back my Treatment. Insanity. My doctor is  writing a letter on my behalf but she told me that she has been denied EVERY SINGLE TIME she's requested her patients moved BACK to Treatment.

I finally went to Philly (where on my first visit, they were planning my surgery to remove my colon..during that conversation I stopped listening.) My dr. suggested I give Treatment a try - before surgery.  At that point, I would have done anything.   Honestly I did not believe anything would work since I had this disease for years and could barely function.

Now that I've been on Treatment for 3 years, I feel like a normal human being again. My disease has become a small part of my life and I don't even think about it much anymore. 

I do seem to be slowly losing response. I had to increase the frequency of infusions and now I sometimes have minor symptoms around the time I am due for my next dose. 

I was nervous when I started this medicine because of the trips to the hospital for infusions and because my doctor at the time made it sound like a huge deal to be on this. I wish I had started it sooner!",Remicade,infliximab,Ulcerative Colitis,NEGATIVE,0.7499977946281433

Prior to that I had a variety of Crohn's issues including two surgeries for peri-anal fistulas, severe fatigue and lots of other fun stuff.  I have been very lucky in that I have responded very well to the stuff and now most days I am fortunate enough to forget I have the disease.  I was apprehensive about potential side effects but to date have experienced none.  Prior to Treatment I took a few medications which did absolutely nothing but the Treatment had a pronounced effect within 24 hours of my first infusion.

I contemplated having surgery to free me of the disease and wear an ostomy. To my eternal gratitude, my Gastro MD suggested Treatment. After my last colonoscopy in 2013, he said if I had not seen you as sick as you were... your colon looks perfectly healthy. I will accept the side effects (I have experienced none as of yet) to have my life back. Treatment has assistance programs to help those who need it. I am not a spokesman, I do not sell this.

I could tell he was in a lot of pain but yet he would not tell me what was going on. Both of us being very uneducated of this disease had no idea of the trouble he was headed towards. I made an appointment with the surgeon, the surgeon confirmed a fistula, and said he needed to take Treatment.
My son has had four Treatment treatments and I have to say he was doing a lot better after the first treatment. It has been almost 9 months now and he is back to his average weight of 190.

I originally discussed with my Doctor about using Treatment for my P-Arthritis and Disease because it is covered by medicare and Treatment is not.  However when I went in I was given Treatment instead. The nurses tell you it's the same thing or a generic version. They use the Treatment for prescribed Treatment patients because it costs less.  The Treatment worked on my first two infusions but by the third  injection it was useless. My arthritis and psoriasis came back in full force. At the last infusion I had an allergic reaction to the Treatment at the hospital and was told by the nurse that I almost ended up in the ER.  Then when I told the nurse that the Infectra wasn't working anyway, she told me to demand Treatment and they would have to give it to me.

Well, several months later all of my hair fell out again and after a year it still hasn't grown back. It might be worth trying if it is a last resort but I wish I never tried it because I had no curative results or relief and I am so depressed that I am a bald woman.

It worked incredibly well for me when I used it every four months.

The bad:
Now I don't know if this is linked to the drug for sure...but a few months after taking the drug my blood tests started coming back abnormal. Later in the year I was diagnosed with PSC (Primary sclerosing cholangitis ) a form of liver disease. Likewise there are lots of horrible side effects like sore throat, fatigue, increased joint pains, etc. Due to the weakened immune system I also got a bunch of infections, especially in hair follicles which caused severe itchiness. I also got a heart infection (pericarditis), two lots of pneumonia and an opportunistic lung infection that forced me to permanently cease use of the drug. My consultant told me if I remained on it I would die. So all of these infections are all pretty serious and life threatening. Only take this drug if you are desperate and have no other options.

Previously tried everything including PUVA, UVB & Tar, Dithranol, Topica Steroids, Topical Calcipitrol , Acetretin, Cyclosporin, Methotrexate, Fumaric Acid Esters, Infliximab (Treatment) and finally now Treatment.
All treatments with the exception of Acetretin and Cyclosporin have been effective to some degree up to full clearance but the relapse time was always short. Was on Treatment for 3.5 years which was very effective but lost its effect over the last 6 months. Have just had my 3rd set of injections (2 at a time) and am as clear as I have ever been in 52 years. Truly life changing. Paid for by NHS!",Stelara,ustekinumab,Psoriasis,NEGATIVE,0.968841552734375

It was down to about 10-15% by the time I had my second injection, and down to about 5% by the time I had my third.  It has remained about that level since, but now only consists of flat pinkish spots that barely itch at all and look more like old scars than the scabby, cracked, bleeding mess they were before.

As for the side effects; I seem to be more prone to various infections than before.  I seem to catch colds more easily.  Also, I usually feel some muscle pain and fatigue starting the day after my injection and lasting for a couple of days (easily dealt with by scheduling my appointments on Friday afternoons and taking it easy over the weekend).",Stelara,ustekinumab,Psoriasis,NEGATIVE,0.9987296462059021

I am JC negative currently.",,,,NEGATIVE,0.9992849230766296
757,For Multiple Sclerosis,10.0,"I have been taking Treatment for a decade and it has been a Godsend!!! My MRIs have shown improvement and the only side effect is that I become tired, an hour after the infusion, and stay low energy for the rest of that night.  The next day, though, I'm full of energy, steady on my feet and in a great mood! The week, before infusion, I start losing balance again, but that's the whole of it... until this month, when I tested JCV positive for the first time. I hope and pray that my doctor and I can find something that is equally effective and does not pose the same PML risk for JCV+ patients!!",,,,POSITIVE,0.9583663940429688
758,For Multiple Sclerosis,3.0,"I was on tysabri for 7 months.... I think, at first I would be extremely agitated, tired and weak, by around month 4 I started getting pain in the top of my right hip have never experienced pain so unbelievably intense,  if it was even just slightly touched I would drop to the ground in utter agony, I began to slur my words and became emotionally unstable.  Treatment seems to give me a much larger amount of MS which is annoying because they told me it had the least side effects and was by far the most effective. Glad to hear it helps other sufferers though . It's under PBS in Australia so they would only sting me for $37.50 a treatment.",,,,NEGATIVE,0.9955737590789795
