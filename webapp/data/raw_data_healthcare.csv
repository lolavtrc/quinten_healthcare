0,Inflectra (infliximab) for Crohn's Disease,1,"Insurance forced me to switch to inflectra due to being cheaper for THEM for my Crohn's. I did not have a say, and insurance won't listen to Dr. recommendations. While on Remicade I only had flare ups 3 days a month during my period,  but no other issues or side effects. Yet after only 2 infusions on Inflectra I have multiple daily loose stools regardless of healthy diet, as well as bloody stools at least once a day.  In addition to Inflectra not preventing flare ups, inflammation, and symptoms; Inflectra has incurred more issues that I didn't have previously:
Kidney pain
Rib Pain
Joint pain: shoulders,  wrists,  ankles.
Nausea
Headaches
Severe Fatigue 
Charlie horse cramping in my hands, where I can't move my thumb; it's completely contracted.

I'm in my early 40's with a toddler to try to keep up with,  as well as career to maintain, and this isn't fair to me or my family."
1,Remicade (infliximab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,,My wife had RA from when she was a child. She had used the normal meds till remicade. She was in Japan and started on remicade in Apr 2007 and die in Feb 2008 from the reactions/side effect to it. I advise that if you get any of the side effect symptoms to see your doctor right away. I have found that if you get one symptom you will get more. There are 3 pages of side effects/reactions.
2,Remicade (infliximab) for Ulcerative Colitis,1,"This medication Remicade made me in constant pain. I slept for two months 20 hours a day. I felt very depressed. My body was in pain everywhere and I was covered in a rash. Parts of my body have permanent nerve damage months after I got off it. My specialist told me it is hard to diagnose nerve damage, as if that matters. Is everyone a liar till a doctor proves it? This same specialists wanted me to go back on it. I said I really didn't want to go through that again. The specialist would not leave it alone. I Mentioned Covid-19 to him and he said it won't make a difference if I am off remicade or not. Oh okay, I guess all these tests were for nothing then? Now I am without a specialist. He then talked down about me to my family doctor saying I am refusing treatment. Now my family doctor is treating me like I am just wasting people's time. I suspect this is exactly how people become homeless. Do I have no rights? People should consider their specialist might value money more than your life."
3,Inflectra (infliximab) for Crohn's Disease,1,"I have Fistulizing Crohn's, dx'd 6 yrs ago @ 36yo- 11 surgeries since then: abscesses, fistulae, drains. 
Years of my life, my career, independence & ability to have biological children lost but Remicade saved my life. I've been in Remission since early 2018-.Trough levels in high 20's.
At JUST that time, my insurance made mandatory switch: ALL patients on Remicade to Inflectra. Since that time, trough levels have steadily dropped to where I'm near rejection & TERRIFIED to start developing abscesses & fistulas again- I'd rather die. Seriously.
I'm now writing to Medicare Commissioner who's probably some paper pusher w/o any IBD training to SAVE MY LIFE & give back my Remicade. Insanity. My doctor is  writing a letter on my behalf but she told me that she has been denied EVERY SINGLE TIME she's requested her patients moved BACK to Remicade. It's criminal that insurance companies pick drug therapy for a disease that literally BURROWS HOLES through my body. I am only 42 & deserve a chance."
4,Remicade (infliximab) for Ulcerative Colitis,10,"Remicade literally gave me my life back 9 yrs ago.  I was so ill ; in & out of hospitals, steroids, taking 20+ pills a day & I was still extremely sick.  I finally went to Philly (where on my first visit, they were planning my surgery to remove my colon..during that conversation I stopped listening.) My dr. suggested I give Remicade a try - before surgery.  At that point, I would have done anything.   Honestly I did not believe anything would work since I had this disease for years and could barely function.  The Remicade worked like magic - it is liquid gold - I have never had any side effects or adverse reactions -  I have been in remission ever since!"
5,Remicade (infliximab) for Ulcerative Colitis,10,"Life-changing. I once thought I was doomed to a life of pain and suffering. Now that I've been on Remicade for 3 years, I feel like a normal human being again. My disease has become a small part of my life and I don't even think about it much anymore. 

I do seem to be slowly losing response. I had to increase the frequency of infusions and now I sometimes have minor symptoms around the time I am due for my next dose. 

I was nervous when I started this medicine because of the trips to the hospital for infusions and because my doctor at the time made it sound like a huge deal to be on this. I wish I had started it sooner!"
6,Remicade (infliximab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,"Horrible joint swelling/pain, fatigue like none other.  Diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, Dr. figures I probably have had this 15 years, a few replacements along the way.  Took MAJOR flare to be diagnosed.  Loads of joint damage all over.  Started on Remicade, nervous.  Cannot take methotrexate due to kidney disease.  Third dose dr increased dose, 5 days feeling worn then MIRACLE!  NO swelling, pain, best I have been in years, no fatigue.  Hoping it continues with each infusion.  In tears of joy everyday with my quality of life."
7,"Remicade (infliximab) for Crohn's Disease, Maintenance",10,"I have been on Remicade for nearly 4 years.  Prior to that I had a variety of Crohn's issues including two surgeries for peri-anal fistulas, severe fatigue and lots of other fun stuff.  I have been very lucky in that I have responded very well to the stuff and now most days I am fortunate enough to forget I have the disease.  I was apprehensive about potential side effects but to date have experienced none.  Prior to Remicade I took a few medications which did absolutely nothing but the Remicade had a pronounced effect within 24 hours of my first infusion.  If you have Crohn's or Colitis would seriously consider an anti TNF blocker (haven't used any of the others) and stay the hell away from steroids."
8,Remicade (infliximab) for Ulcerative Colitis,10,"I had a second relapse of Ulcerative Colitis in 2005. I spent 2 weeks in hospital, been given a fist full of medicines and sent home. Nothing worked. I contemplated having surgery to free me of the disease and wear an ostomy. To my eternal gratitude, my Gastro MD suggested Remicade. After my last colonoscopy in 2013, he said if I had not seen you as sick as you were... your colon looks perfectly healthy. I will accept the side effects (I have experienced none as of yet) to have my life back. Remicade has assistance programs to help those who need it. I am not a spokesman, I do not sell this. But I use and will as long as I can. I wish this medicine was around for my Dad as he suffered with Crohns and Colitis for years."
9,Remicade (infliximab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,10,"I have been taking this med for over ten years now truly a life saver. I have had no side effects and have been able to do almost everything I used too. I only take Remicade, no methotrexate as I took myself off of that because of liver side effects. I also have for several years now extended my infusion out to every 10 weeks I am the only patient I know who does this. I have not seen any negative effects from doing this. Great drug"
10,"Remicade (infliximab) for Crohn's Disease, Maintenance",10,"My son has crohns and lost 30 lbs in 2.5 months. He took the medicine the doctor said to take but then he developed a fistula. I could tell he was in a lot of pain but yet he would not tell me what was going on. Both of us being very uneducated of this disease had no idea of the trouble he was headed towards. I made an appointment with the surgeon, the surgeon confirmed a fistula, and said he needed to take Remicade.
My son has had four Remicade treatments and I have to say he was doing a lot better after the first treatment. It has been almost 9 months now and he is back to his average weight of 190. We are both afraid of the Remicade and we don't talk about it very much at all but I do have to admit it has given my son his life back."
11,Inflectra (infliximab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,1,"Watch out for Inflectra.  I originally discussed with my Doctor about using Remicade for my P-Arthritis and Psoriasis because it is covered by medicare and Humira is not.  However when I went in I was given Inflectra instead. The nurses tell you it's the same thing or a generic version. They use the Inflectra for prescribed Remicade patients because it costs less.  The Inflectra worked on my first two infusions but by the third  injection it was useless. My arthritis and psoriasis came back in full force. At the last infusion I had an allergic reaction to the Inflectra at the hospital and was told by the nurse that I almost ended up in the ER.  Then when I told the nurse that the Infectra wasn't working anyway, she told me to demand Remicade and they would have to give it to me.  A report about the allergic reaction and Inflectra not working went to my doctor and now I am supposed to start Remicade this weekend.  I'll post a review on Remicade once I have had a few treatments."
12,Remicade (infliximab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,"I was diagnosed with a reactive Rheumatoid Arthritis August 1998 after getting the first shot of Hepatitis B vaccine which triggered my RA. I was on Prednisone for a year, Plaquenil, sulafalazine(which almost killed me), arava (leflunomide) for a while, was on Humira which didint help, changed to Enbrel which gave me rashes. In 2000, my rheumatologist who was into RA research and had RA himself ordered Remicaide infusion wtih MTX. That's 15 years ago of quality of life and contnuing 5mg Remicaide every 10 weeks. All my RA labs and tests are negative except CCP (which is 5X higher than the normal. This coming month I'll be OFF my MTX. Even when I'm on Remission I did not stop my Remicaide coz flare ups are worst than the first symptoms."
13,Remicade (infliximab) for Ulcerative Colitis,1,"My younger brother was on remicade for 10 years , and yes it helped him with the uc but he just passed away from cancer and liver failure at 27 years old most likely from the years of remicade. So I am leaving the warning to be careful and think that this is just some miracle drug.  Everything has consequences"
14,Remicade (infliximab) for Ulcerative Colitis,10,I have been getting Remicade infusions for 4 1/2 years.  I went into remission within a week of my first infusion. My only side effects I have are headaches and some chest pain off and on.  But considering how my life was before Remicade I can handle it for now.
15,Inflectra (infliximab) for Ulcerative Colitis,1,"Insurance company switched me off my Remicaid to the cheaper drug, Inflectra causing severe flare. Headaches, nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting. No energy during the day, I have to take several naps just to get through the day. I had just gotten used to being and feeling better after fighting with my colitis. The Remiciad put me into remission and now I'm sick again because of Inflectra."
16,"Remicade (infliximab) for Crohn's Disease, Maintenance",10,"I was diagnosed with Crohn's Disease when I was 26 years old and  I am now 66 and have been on Remicade since 2008.  I get my infusion every 8 weeks and for me it works for my Crohn's.  I am somewhat tired after my infusion, sometimes the next day for about half the day.  For me I can't imagine not being on it."
17,Remicade (infliximab) for Ulcerative Colitis,8,"I have been diagnosed with UC for about 15 years.  I have been on various forms of mesalamine for the entire time.  On and off of prednisone, 5-60 mg a day.  Remicade had me close to remission for 5 years.  While on Remicade I was able to drop the prednisone.  For that, I'm grateful for the Remicade.  After about 5 years it suddenly lost it's effectiveness.  I then went back to the Prednisone while waiting to get approved for Entyvio.  Remicade was given via IV every two months.  Entyvio did absolutely nothing for me.  I'm now on Simponi which is starting to show promising results.  It supposedly works on the same inhibitors as Remicade.  A lot of trial and error.  Be patient and keep the faith."
18,"Remicade (infliximab) for Crohn's Disease, Maintenance",10,"I am a 65 year old male and I acquired Crohn's Disease in 1965 at age 19.  Remicade was approved by the FDA in August of 1998 and I was given my first dose the next month.  Back then, they only administered 2 doses. I received the second dose 3 months after the first one.  I have had no further doses since then.

When I got the first dose I was in the midst of a flare, and I had an actively draining abdominal fistula.  Three days after the first infusion the fistula closed of its own accord and I happily avoided yet another surgery for Crohn's (I have had over 20 surgeries).  

I have been SYMPTOM-FREE since the second infusion.  I have more health issues now, but at least they are not Crohn's related."
19,"Remicade (infliximab) for Crohn's Disease, Maintenance",9,I have been dealing with Crohn's Disease for around ten years now and I was only properly diagnosed 2 yrs ago. I have received Remicade infusions every four weeks for the last year and it has made a very significant improvement in my everyday life. I no longer need to take pain meds to get through the day and my energy levels are closer to normal then they have been in years. Before Remicade it had got to the point where I could barely walk due to lower back and hip pain all related to Crohn's.
20,Remicade (infliximab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,"I was diagnosed with RA about 12 years ago. Started on Methotrexate but had to discontinue because of higher than normal enzyme levels in either my kidneys or liver (can't remember which organ). My RA doctor recommended we switch to a biologic Remicade. I was also on Plaquinel and Leuflunomide along with Remicade but have since discontinued Plaquinel with no issues. Still taking leuflunomide. I've been taking Remicade (800 mg infusion every 6 weeks) and Leuflunimide (pill once a day)now for over 10 years since my diagnosis of RA. I've had no side effects with Remicade or leuflunomide,  no joint damage (caught RA diagnosis very early) and in complete remission for over 10 years. Now my insurance company wants to switch me to Inflectra over Remicade because it is cheaper. I may have no choice but I'll be calling my RA doctor and see what he thinks. May have to appeal to the insurance company if RA doctor has reservations and stay on Remicade which works remarkably for me!"
21,Inflectra (infliximab) for Ulcerative Colitis,1,"Was on REMICADE everything was great and I was back to feeling normal and in remission for long time. My insurance company did a mandatory med change so they could save a little bit of money. Now I'm in major pain again ,going threw flare up and near having to go to ER to get help. One dose of infletra was all it took to mess me up again. My insurance wont even let me back on REMICADE. I truly hope no one else has to be forced on infletra"
22,Remicade (infliximab) for Ulcerative Colitis,10,"Remicade has been a miracle for me. Last year this time I was totally desperate and thinking of get rid of my colon due to severe UC. Now, I am totally healthy and no sign of UC!!! If u r suffering from UC, give it a try without any doubt. Thanks to science and researchers. Of course, it takes couple of months to feel the full effect of it, but as soon as I got the first infusion I felt its positive effect. Its combination with Azathioprine works much better."
23,Remicade (infliximab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,I suffered with RA for over 15 years in most of my joints.  6 years ago I moved to a new state and started with a new RA doctor.  She started me on Remicade and lowered the dosage of methotrexate.  I have been pain free for the past 6 years.  Love my doctor and Remicade.
24,Inflectra (infliximab) for Crohn's Disease,1,"I was forced to switch Biologics due to insurance company wanting to save some money. I was finally feeling somewhat normal after being on Remicade for a year. Now I am taking Inflectra and have been feeling awful. In and out of cramping, zero energy, nauseous all the time and a few other issues. I would like to think my health is more important than my insurance company saving a few dollars...."
25,Remicade (infliximab) for Ulcerative Colitis,10,"I was diagnosed with uc in my twenties. For many years I maintained with various medications and only a couple of relatively minor flare ups.  Suddenly at age 56 I had a severe flare up that did not respond to prednisone. Removing colon was brought up. After much suffering and weight loss for about 3 months I was put on Remicade by my wonderful GI. Within a couple of weeks my condition began to improve. I am now almost 7 years with infusions every 8 weeks. I am very grateful for this medication, although I do wonder if my immune system is weakened. It really doesn't compare to almost dying or having major surgery. I know it doesn't work for everyone but for me it was a miracle."
26,Remicade (infliximab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,"Had been on REMICADE since 2003 (11 years) 5vials every 4weeks. Doctor took it away due to issues with the infusion dept. I hate not being on REMICADE. REMICADE did wonders for me, it gave me life back and unfortunately I am back to where I started 11+ years ago. I am having difficulty with everything, I can barely type this comment."
27,"Remicade (infliximab) for Crohn's Disease, Maintenance",7,"Right after my daughters 13 yr. birthday, she had severe bleeding and was diagnosed with severe crohns and colitis.  She has been on Remicade since January and has infusions every six weeks.  She was on put on Prednisone in March since the infusions did not stop the bleeding alone.  She is now being weened off the steroids, Thank God, and is on Remicade for the rest if ths year for now.  She gets a boost of energy and after her infusions, but is very smart about what she can and cant eat. Prayers to u all going through this."
28,Remicade (infliximab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,,"I love it!  I'm 16 and have been treated for five years.  Methotrexate made me sick and Enbrel, via Epi pen, was more uncomfortable than my arthritis.  Remicade is pain free and the time inconvenience is worth it."
29,"Remicade (infliximab) for Crohn's Disease, Maintenance",10,"I have had Crohn's Disease for 18 years. I was extremely ill for the first 8 years. My doctor put me on Methotrexate, and I got better, but not ""well"". Then, Remicade came out. I have been getting infusions every 8 weeks for over 7 years, and it has saved my life. I will say, though, that at one time they hoped to wean me off of the Methotrexate, but I started having flare-ups and the time between infusions was increased. Since I am back on the Methotrexate and Remicade, I have had no problems at all. Yes, I know my immune system is very weak, but I avoid anyone who is sick, and try to get enough rest when I can. This combination of drugs has worked for me and I hope I have helped someone out there! You may need something else with Remicade. "
30,"Remicade (infliximab) for Crohn's Disease, Maintenance",10,"I have been on Remicade since I was 7 years old when I developed crohns disease, I am 26 years old this year. For the past 19 years I have been receiving this medicine and it has kept me healthy. You do need to find a cycle be it 4, 6 or 8 weeks for your infusions. I do every 6 weeks and it keeps my symptoms minimal. The day of and the day after the infusion I feel like crap, tired, painful joints, but after that wears off I feel a lot better than before the infusion."
31,Remicade (infliximab) for Ulcerative Colitis,8,I have only been living with this UC for about 5 months and couldn’t find anything to help .After 1st infusion notice a big improvement till I hurt my back and took a lot of   Ibuprofen and   Aleve for the pain and had major  flare up had my 2nd infusion and then that clear up by about 80%. Now have  anxieties but not from remicade going for my 3rd infusion in 2-1/2 weeks then every 8 weeks. Prayers and positive attitude and good diet I will be fine
32,Remicade (infliximab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,9,"I went in yesterday morning at 9am to receive my first infusion of Remicade.
Had my IV inserted in my arm, and had my vitals checked at the beginning and then every 15-30 minutes.
By the time I was leaving the doctor, it was about 1:00pm. So it takes a while for the first time, but after that it won't take as long.
The only kind of downside to it was that I got just a little sleepy, which I read was common.
It's 1:15pm, the following day of my first infusion and I haven't felt a single ounce of pain in any of my joints. I understand it's only 24 hours later but I am usually in a lot of pain all morning and I didn't have any morning stiffness when I got out of bed this morning.
Very pleased so far!"
33,Remicade (infliximab) for Ulcerative Colitis,10,"I was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis about 12 years ago and have been on Remicade for about 2 of those years. I am still taking Asacol and getting the Remicade infusions every 8 weeks, but I feel about 90-95% better since being on Remicade. I have not noticed any real side effects from taking Remicade, but I have heard from other patients that they have had them. I still think that if I had any side effects (with the exception) of major ones, I would stay on it as long as I can. The only thing I honestly can complain about is the cost. I would say if anyone is being told that it is an option for their ulcerative colitis or any of the other issues that are in the same family (IBS, Crohn's, etc) it is a huge help."
34,Remicade (infliximab) for Crohn's Disease,10,"First couple trips are the worst but after that it becomes a routine and it works wonders I'm not lying it gave me my life back until my insurance couldn't pay now I use 
Humira no competition. Remicade hands downed so if you are doing bad try it."
35,Remicade (infliximab) for Ulcerative Colitis,10,I used Remicade for a little over a year and it helped tremendously. While I was on it I never felt better. The only reason I had to stop taking it was because I lost my insurance after I was laid off. My doctors office found a program to help pay for the treatments and I will be going back on the Remicade soon. Can't wait.
36,Remicade (infliximab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,10,I have severe psoriatic arthritis and I've had it since I was 18. I've been on remicade for almost 10 years and I have almost no pain. My joints get a little stiff close to my infusion but that's it. It is my miracle drug and I owe my life to it. I would be crippled without it.
37,Remicade (infliximab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,9,"For two year (09' 10') we were trying to figure out why my knee hurt so bad. Over the two years it moved into my whole body! I had seen 5 doctors but they had no idea and gave me guidelines of what I could not do. Which made the RA flare up worse. On Dec. 8, 10 I was at school (I am not one to complain about pain) and I broke down crying. My rheumatoid arthritis had gotten so bad in my back that it started shuting down my SNS and I could not walk. I had to have my friends carry me to the school office. My parents stayed home with me for a week because I could not move without someone. We were able to get in to see a pediatric rheumatologist on Dec. 15 10. That day I was dianosed with the disease. This is the first medicine that has helped."
38,"Remicade (infliximab) for Crohn's Disease, Maintenance",6,"My son started Remicade at 13yrs. He has severe Crohns flare ups and this was a last resort aside from surgery for him. The Remicade treatment gave him few side effects. He didn't get any headaches/tiredness. And he didn't get sick easier like they said he would. When almost our whole house(7 of us) got the flu; m\Micah didn't. Micah just took his last dose 8 weeks ago after being on Remicade for over a year and a half. (Micah was on Lialda too) even when they used the amount of Remicade, Micah was still getting flare ups every other month or so. They tested his blood and found out he had antibodies to the Remicade, which means his body was attacking the Remicade and that's why it was only working right after the infusions."
39,Remicade (infliximab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,I have been on two other DMARDs (Enbrel and Orencia) with little or only so-so results. With Remicade I felt relief almost immediately with no adverse reactions. I noticed my inflammation and pain have greatly decreased but most importantly the fatigue that dogged me has lifted. I am hoping that this medicine keeps working for a long time. Best wishes.
40,Remicade (infliximab) for Ulcerative Colitis,10,"I was diagnosed with UC in March 2015 out of nowhere.. Rapidly got bad and needed to be hospitalized for a week to get the flare under control.. Was given heavy doses of steroids (awful) and they did nothing to help.. I was released from the hospital after a week and symptoms were still bad.. About 2 weeks later after not being able to eat and losing 20lbs I was barely able to walk and was readmitted, this time I went to Columbia in NYC.. I wasn't able to eat for the full first week in the hospital and symptoms were steadily horrible.. My doctor decided to give me a loading dose of remicade and the results were almost immediate! I have been on remicade every 8 weeks since and don't have a single symptom of UC

It's been a life saver!"
41,Remicade (infliximab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,"I had been on Remicade for many years with no side effects at all, perhaps a little tired every once in a while, but nothing serious.  My doctor and I questioned whether I had rheumatoid arthritis. Then all of a sudden the Remicade stopped working and bam I had 2 flares that were unbelievable before doc could get anything to work for me.  I was heart broken because it was such a good medicine for me."
42,Remicade (infliximab) for Ulcerative Colitis,9,"I was diagnosed 3 years ago with severe Ulcerative Colitis. Asacol and predisone worked at first, but after each outbreak the medicines seemed less effective. My last attack left me under 100lbs, severely anemic, and in enough pain that I needed to be kept in a continuous Dilaudid-induced daze. So many people have told me how terrible Remicade is and that I just need to, ""find the right diet"". If diet works for you, great! Remicade was the only thing that worked for me. The cons: It's expensive, but luckily my insurance covers it. It's inconvenient to go to the hospital every 6 weeks. I havn't noticed any side effects except hair loss at first, but now my hair is growing back. I've been told that the hair loss could also have been from all the weight loss."
43,Remicade (infliximab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,9,"I was on Remicade for the past four years. It has recently started giving me bad reactions during the infusion. My arthritis would also flare 1.5-2 weeks after the infusion. Loved Remicade, hated how expensive it was."
44,Remicade (infliximab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,"After a double synovectomy of my right wrist and left elbow in 1985 at the age of twenty, I had sixteen years of remission, until 2001 when I had a downward spiral rheumatic flare.  I was disabled for eight months and my Rheumatologist put me on very high doses of Methotrexate and Vioxx.  I was only able to walk with a cane.  Relief in 2002 to 2003 and another flare-up dislocated my left wrist and crippled my fingers.  Started the year 2004 with a synovectomy of the left wrist.  At this point I had enough of the Methotrexate and Vioxx.  I sought alternative treatments of Gloucosamine/MSM, with Tylenol Arthritis for pain.  2006 Flare-up, I moved to RTP,  where my Doctor introduced me to Remicade with medium doses of Methotrexate.  No pain, I'm happy."
45,Remicade (infliximab) for Ulcerative Colitis,10,"I could not get the colitis under control for 18 months, finally my doctor prescribed Remicade. Well after the first treatment bleeding stopped and I feel like a normal person again. Only small side effect for me is I feel a bit  dizzy just after the treatment"
46,"Inflectra (infliximab) for Crohn's Disease, Maintenance",1,My adult daughter’s both have Crohn’s disease and are on Inflectra and both now have Fistulas which should never had happened while on infusion therapy. My oldest daughter was feeling great on Remicade but to save money her insurance company made her change to Inflectra.
47,"Remicade (infliximab) for Crohn's Disease, Maintenance",7,"This nightmare all started 9 years ago with an abcess. This turned into a fistula. The fistula went away after years then I developed another one on the opposite side. Then multiple fistulas. 10 surgeries later and now I have a fistula through the 
vagina. I finally changed Drs. My dr put me on remicade and methotraxate, and I am finally seeing results. Extremely tired I could continuously sleep my life away. I haven't felt any inflamation for weeks. No pain pills for 4 weeks now. So cross my fingers this works."
48,"Remicade (infliximab) for Crohn's Disease, Maintenance",9,"I am 37 and have had Crohn's since I was 18. Three surgeries of the terminal Ilieum. From 18 to 27 I was very very ill. The Remicade has basically helped me to have a normal life again. I feel great these days, but one gets to the point where you feel good and want to be medicine free. You hear horror stories of people getting off Remicade and getting galloping Crohn's disease coming back and then the Remicade doesn't work so well."
49,Remicade (infliximab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,1,"Have had 4 Remicade infusions in combination with MTX and Plaquinil. The 1st infusion was great and all my pain was gone. I thought OMG a miracle drug! Then 2nd infusion I had a reaction which felt like I was having a stress test performed, a bit scary and then the hands and feet broke out with a horrible psoriasis type rash which I have never had before (and still can't seem to cure). 3rd infusion with Benadryl injection was 6 hours of slight reaction and then little or no relief from the pain. 4th injection with twice as much Benadryl prior to the injection and 10 hours of reaction while being infused and zero relief after. the fact. I gave up on Remicade. "
50,Remicade (infliximab) for Ulcerative Colitis,10,"Severe UC flare hospitalized, prednisone intravenous didn't do anything. Remicade infusions every 4 weeks to start, now every 8. It worked within one week and after about one year I was in complete remission with no sign of UC on my colonoscopy! The IV is okay, very expensive, but you can go to the Remicade website for help paying deductibles no matter what your financial situation is. I wish my dr told me that before I spent $10,000 in deductible and copay this year! I guess it was worth it all around."
51,Remicade (infliximab) for Ulcerative Colitis,6,"I had severe pancolitis and was hospitalized for 2 weeks. They started me on remicade because none of the mesalamine ever worked for me. It worked at first really well and worked well for about 2 months. After that the flare ups became so bad they were giving it to me every week. Even that didn't work this time around so the only option I had was surgery. The doctors didn't want to try other medications since I already had so much remicade in my system. After the surgery I immediately felt great. Some people might not like the idea of having a ostomy but I have gotten use to it. I did have the opportunity to get a j pouch, but one of my dads friend had a very bad experience so I decided not to."
52,Remicade (infliximab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,8,"Remicade is the only medicine I have taken in the last 6yrs that has given me relief.  I was scared to try it, but I have not had any side effects and the improvement is significant.  It kicks in quickly for me (within a day), but it also wears off before my insurance will let me get another dose.  Some relief is better than none, though, so no complaints from me.  I only hope that I don't build up an immunity to it anytime soon."
53,Remicade (infliximab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,8,"Getting up in the morning and walking around is a lot less challenging since I started Remicade in June 2008. Before Remicade, I'd have to sit down in my tripod stool after just crossing the street due to extreme fatigue. Now I can walk to the grocery and back."
54,"Remicade (infliximab) for Crohn's Disease, Maintenance",,"Ok I have had Crohn's disease for 15 years this December. I have maintained myself just fine with minor problems. Recently have learned my pain tolerance is so extreme I have been putting up with stuff shouldn't be for uncertain amount of time. Two questions from people with experience would help:
1. How is it going forward with these fistulas? Unheard of before last Wednesday and I have two forming or in process of. 
2. I have limited options going forward and Remicade is seeming best course of action. How have people done with it long term it being an immune suppressant?
I am knowledgeable about these things I am hoping to hear from people who have experience dealing with fistulas and taking Remicade.
Thanks,

55,Remicade (infliximab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,9,"Just had 3rd remicade infusion, can't believe all I'm able to do. Due to some joint damage in knees and hips, not totally free of pain. Best I've felt in years. Severely reduced prednisone after 3 years, plan to stop. Diagnosed in 2013, but have had symptoms off and on for 25 Years. Little to no improvement with humira, enbrel, orencia, Actemra,plaquenil,methotrexate made me sick, xeljanz,sulfasalazine. Vitamins, no sugar, wheat or milk helped me also. Joint pain and swelling nearly gone. Praying it lasts, thanking God."
56,Remicade (infliximab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,2,"After several years on the drug I developed asthma and then chronic bronchitis which ended with a severe bout of pneumonia. This happened despite my taking the vaccination of it. Please be aware of these problems. I had told my doctor who really did  not listen until I got very sick and then agreed it was in part, the Remicade"
57,Remicade (infliximab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,"I was diagnosed with Inflammatory Arthritis (RA) September of 2015 (29 years old). First I was on Plaquenil which never seemed to help and on top of it I developed a terrible hive rash which went away once I stopped taking it. Next I tried Humira. That worked great for about 6 months before my symptoms came back. Now I'm on Remicade and have been for almost a year now. It works great. I get my infusion every 8 weeks and have NO SYMPTOMS!! I love Remicade. It gave me my life back. I am slightly concerned though because I've developed another rash that won't seem to go away after 2 months of dealing with it, trying steroids etc etc. Cross your fingers it's not Remicade causing my rash. I'll cry!"
58,"Remicade (infliximab) for Crohn's Disease, Maintenance",8,I'm 32 and I've had crohns now for 14 years. Remicade was a god send but only for a limited time. I started off like everyone else with i. V every 8 weeks. Then after a couple of years it was wearing off faster so then every 6 weeks. Then every 4 weeks then it was back on the steroids along with the 4 week treatment. Well after 6-7 years on remicade it wasn't working anymore. I do recommend it because I would give anything right now to get those 6 years back because even though I was became immune to it I felt 20 times better then compared to now. Since the remicade nothing has worked for me since.
59,Remicade (infliximab) for Ulcerative Colitis,10,"I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis in Nov. They thought they that had it under control, so after being in the hospital for three weeks, I went home for two and almost died! I went back and stayed for over a month. The docs were trying everything with no answers, then they told me about Remicade and said it was for Crohn's disease, but we could try it out and see because it was my last hope. I really was happy to see that it was working and in the first of Jan I went home! I have had a kidney stone because of it, and it has acted up which made docs think it was either my appendix or diverticulitis. I still take it every 8wk through I.V, but the only other problem that I'm experiencing is hair loss now and I don't know if its the Remicade."
60,Remicade (infliximab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,6,"Used for psoriatic arthritis, the 1st of 3 IV infusions that work great to begin with! From joints becoming near normal to a bounce in my step - then the canker sores are the 1st sign I'm flaring! I went thru 2 severe reactions before realizing it was the drug, which required immediate emergency attention as it affected my breathing, had hives and 2 weeks of misery. If only my body didn't fine ways to subvert all the Docs do to try & help it! It's frustrating!"
61,"Remicade (infliximab) for Crohn's Disease, Maintenance",10,"I am a 28 year old male and was diagnosed with Crohn's 6 years ago. I had a flare up with an abdominal aneurysm and lost approx 90 lbs. I was put on Remicade and it has saved my life. I have been on it every 8 weeks for about 4 years and have regained a healthy weight and my symptoms are at an all time low. My only complaints are that getting the treatment is time consuming and the cost is obscene if you don't have good insurance. However, despite all that, it truly has saved my life and I couldn't be happier with the actual results of the medication."
62,Remicade (infliximab) for Ulcerative Colitis,8,"When my daughter was 13, she had a sudden and severe onset of UC. She was hospitalized for 2 weeks (had constant pain, couldn't eat, and was going to the bathroom  15-20x/ day). She was given IV steroids/medications with no improvement of symptoms. The day after receiving remicade, her pain was gone and she wanted to eat. She went into complete remission and has had no symptoms for the last  4 years. She  does remicade infusions every 10 weeks.  It has been her wonder drug! But my other dtr was diagnosed with crohns a year later at 11. Her onset was slower and she was put on various medications first. Remicade worked for her for several months but then became less effective even with increasing dose and frequency so she was switched to humi"
63,Remicade (infliximab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,10,"I had my first infusion last week and within 3 days, I can honestly say I have no pain for the first time in weeks.  I didn't have any reactions or side effects except for feeling exhausted, but that maybe related to not being able to sleep for weeks prior, due to pain.  I am so happy with the effectiveness and results I have had.  I would definitely recommend it!"
64,"Remicade (infliximab) for Crohn's Disease, Maintenance",10,"I have been on this medication for 14 years now, and maintained remission without any meds. I also had 2 healthy babies while on Remicade.  

I was diagnosed with CD of my ilium at 20 years old. I had been on Pentasa and then Imuran.  Imuran worked okay, but it hurt my stomach and I never felt truly ""good"".  I was put on Remicade after my last blockage in 2006, and I have been in true remission ever since with Remicade alone. 

I am a little tired after my infusion for a day, but then I feel totally normal.  My two kids had no side effects from using during pregnancy.  They are now 6 and 3.  I had 2 c-sections, with no complications.  The only thing it affected, was that my kids couldn't get the Rotavirus vaccine, because it was a live vaccine. (No live vaccines until 6 months for Remicade babies).  That vaccine is new and not critical.  

Remicade has a payment assistance program and they help with co-pays, regardless of income."
65,"Remicade (infliximab) for Crohn's Disease, Maintenance",10,"I am now 80 years old and was diagnosed with Crohn's about 3 years ago.  Late in life, I know, but was misdiagnosed with IBS and put on mesalmine which only made  me lose my appetite, lost so much energy that I could not walk 10 feet.  Went to teaching hospital and was quickly suspected and diagnosed with Crohns.  Shortly afterwards put on Remicade.  Total remission, regained strength and bowel control within a week and appetite.  At first on 8 weeks but noted tendency to some flare tendency toward the end so put on 6 weeks.  Have had no problems and lead a ""normal"" life with wife, children and grandchildren now!  Make sure I follow doctor's advise including all vaccinations he recommends.  He does full blood work before every infusion.  He is very quick to respond to any contacts or questions I make with him."
66,Remicade (infliximab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,"I was on enbrel for nearly 9 years before it stopped working and humira didn't work at all for me. I started remicade nearly 4 years ago, my Dr started me out getting an infusion every 8 weeks and over the first year he brought it down to every 4 weeks. It's been working great but after the first 2 years my knees started bothering me but after some injection at my orthopedist they have been under control. Now both my elbows are really bothering me, at first it was when I woke up but now it's 24-7. I go in for my next infusion next week and will talk to my rheumatologist about the pain. I was curious to see if anyone else has had knee or elbow pain after being on remicade"
67,Remicade (infliximab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,10,I have been taking Remicade infusions since September 2005 and I can't say anything negative about it. I go in for the infusion hurting and aching and come out feeling so much better. Worth the 12 sticks it sometimes takes to get me started infusing.
68,"Remicade (infliximab) for Crohn's Disease, Maintenance",,"I've had Crohn's for 12 years and I'm 44 now. I believe my Crohn's was triggered or worsened by a doctor misdiagnosing my lower back/hip joint pain from Crohn's and prescribing heavy Ibuprofen. I tried Asacol, Imuran, and Pentasa, but always ended up taking prednisone to calm the symptoms. Every February I ended up with flare-ups. Doctor put me on Remicade 4 years ago and other than some swelling up in the hands initially and getting perma-colds occasionally, it has worked very well. Now my insurance is trying to force me to go to Humira. Doctor is fighting it, but we'll see how it goes. Hope this helps."
69,Remicade (infliximab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,8,"I was diagnosed w/ severe RA in 2009 by my general practitioner who discovered it through a blood test, which is not always common. Well, after being on MTX 8pills/a wk. (for 8 yrs) and Arava daily I have also been on Enbrel, Humira, Actemra, Orencia & Zeljanz one worked most didn't. I finally just started Remicade infusion on 2/16/17. The first day I slept 20 hrs. a few days later no change then yesterday ~The Miracle Day~ not one single pain, no flare ups 100% pain free! OMG I was so happy I cried! Today not so good as yesterday but I'm very hopeful! Good Luck to the rest of you all!!!"
70,Remicade (infliximab) for Crohn's Disease,8,"I went on this medicine in 2003 because of disease in my ileum. I was diagnosed with Crohn's the year before, and nothing had worked - asacol, prednisone, imuran.  Then Remicade was a LIFESAVER! I actually could live my life like a normal person again! I had a hard time scheduling my infusions because I was in college, so my advice would be to get it as close to your due date (7 weeks, 8 weeks, etc) as you can so you can get ahead of the flare. I've noticed that if I get my remicade late, I feel pretty terrible until my next dose. I've never gotten sick or had an allergic reaction from it, and I've been on it for 15 years. It's not working as well as it once did, so I'm hoping I can change to a shot so I don't have to sit through an infusion. If you're considering going on Remicade, I highly recommend it. It helped me live a semi-normal life. However, I did develop psoriasis about 10 years ago. I'd happily take psoriasis if it means I can be on Remicade. Best of luck!"
71,"Remicade (infliximab) for Crohn's Disease, Maintenance",7,"I am a 16 year old male, and was diagnosed with Crohn's disease when I was 8. I have only been on Remicade for about 8 months, but have not seen much of a difference. My energy has stayed the same, and I haven't grown any. Improvements have been that I don't have the morning cramps that I usually get, and my appetite has grown. I went from 135 pounds before the infusions to 145 pounds. I have a bloody nose at least three times a week, I now catch stomach viruses a lot easier now, and I feel dizzy/lightheaded often. Overall I guess it's working, I will do an update when I have been on the medicine longer."
72,Remicade (infliximab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,9,"I have had rheumatoid arthirtis for 1 year now, and continue to take Sulfasalazine and Nabumetone daily. I stopped taking the Enbrel after 7 months as it was no longer relieving joint pains.  I have had two infusions so far, and do notice improvement in my most painful joint (shoulder).  My rheumatologist prescribed a dose pack of steroids, which I took after my 1st infusion. Receiving these drugs together, I was hoping for more improvement, but I will take what I can get.  My arm has markedly improved range of motion, although it is not back to normal. My legs are still stiff, and I still need to shuffle my feet when I walk.  I go back for my third infusion next month, and thereafter infusions will be every 6-8 weeks.  I sure am hopeful this treatment will improve my quality of life."
73,"Remicade (infliximab) for Crohn's Disease, Maintenance",1,I have received Remicade infusions to treat Crohn's. Felt bad right after the first infusion but was convinced by my physician to continue. I have also received Prolia by injection to treat osteoporosis. I decided to stop the Remicade after 3 infusions as I could feel no benefit and had felt very ill throughout. 6 months later I was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer - this is in spite of having annual mammograms. I can't help but think the Remicade is linked to the eruption and rapid spread of my cancer. Beware!

I am one of the very fortunate ones to have no real side effects.  I have been on Remicade for at least 6 years.  I am able to hold down an excellent job and enjoy being a wife and mother.  I am grateful that I have a job with great benefits.  I wish that the cost was not so outrageous so that others could benefit from this medicine.  My son is on Humira and they have a program that decreases the cost significantly.  Even with my insurance, they cover a large portion of my co-pay.  All we can do is hope that the makers of Remicade will offer the same some day."

Her fever shot up to 106 and her blood pressure was really low. She spent 24 hrs in the PICU. It was very scared. Needless to say, she won't be able to take it again. We are hoping there will be no lasting effects but only time will tell. Her symptoms of serum sickness were: fever, chills, severe joint pain, hives all over, swollen hands, red eyes, and dry mouth."
76,Remicade (infliximab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,I was diagnosed with RA in 2004 and began steroids and methotrexate. Next started Enbrel for approximately 8 months but the citric acid in the Enbrel was unbarable.  Then I began Remicade Infusions. I started out nine years ago every 6 weeks. I'm now on 700 mg every four weeks and weekly injections of Methotrexate  but wouldn't change a thing. I still have stiffness here or there but the fatigue and pain I use to experience are gone and I live a full and happy life. It's been such a Blessing to me.
77,"Inflectra (infliximab) for Ulcerative Colitis, Maintenance",1,"I was on remicade for 2 years and was able to have my pouchitis under control after the second infusion. No pain or inflammation. Was using the restroom 2 to 4 times a day.

I have felt like rubbish for the past 8 months loose stools using the restroom 10 to12 times a day, cramping, no energy and my inflammation is back. Do not switch to inflectra from remicade. It does not work the same."
78,Inflectra (infliximab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,10,I have using this medication for three years and it has worked very well for me. I have never had a reaction to it and it keeps my ankylosing spondylitis under good control. I was on methotrexate and humira  before and had a major flare up.
79,Remicade (infliximab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,4,"On Remicade for 10 months. At each infusion the dose has gone up with no lasting relief. Now at 800mg every six weeks relief lasted only 2 weeks, 2 days. Back on Prednisone and Darvocet until I see doctor tomorrow. Nothing has worked except combination of Arava and Methotrexate. Had to leave Methotrexate several years ago because of high liver enzymes. At this point nothing seems to give relief except Prednisone and I WILL not take that even more than a few days. Possibly adding Arava to Remicade after tomorrow. I am getting very tired of constant pain."

Last infusion, my insurance wouldn't pay the hospital. After back and forth communications from doctor, hospital and insurance companies..Medicare...Blue Cross/Blue shield,..Tricare....doctor decreased my max dosage to 1/2 dose. Now I'm having a flare. It's a wonderful drug but the cost is exorbitant...especially for old people like me. Sure was good while the Remicade ride was working. Good luck all"
81,Remicade (infliximab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,9,Remicade works well for me. I'm a 30 year old female. I have been on Remicade for 3 years.

I was first put on all the typical drugs: Imuran, Pentasa, Asacol, Prednisone, B-12 injections.  I received the Remicade initially only when I had flare ups.  I watched my diet to a T (specific carbohydrate diet), but would still end up flaring up.  For the past 6 years I have been on a maintenance dose of Remicade every 10 weeks and have done very well.  I do have a goal to eventually get off the Remicade."
83,Remicade (infliximab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,1,"I had RA for a few years and decided to try Remicade, during the infusion my chest started to get tight. I asked the nurse to check me and she checked my blood pressure , it went from 121/78 to over 250/120 in 15 minutes. She switched off the machine and I was taken to the ER for and EKG."
84,Remicade (infliximab) for Ulcerative Colitis,8,The medicine works great. I've been on it for almost 2 years. The only thing is I'm getting a lot of the side effects. The one thing that is very bad is the itching on my arms that have lasted a long time. No medicine has helped so if anyone has any ideas on how to stop the itching please give me ideas. The only good thing about this medicine is that it's helping my ulcerative colitis.
85,Remicade (infliximab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,9,"My first go around in 2008 was like a miracle. No side effects! After 3 infusions I lost my medical coverage. Remicade took away the morning stiffness and the pain so much I was able to do push ups and squats. If you looked at my stooped forward posture you would know why that's such a big deal. I eventually started driving the city bus after being denied for Social Security. In Sept of 2010, after 2 years of no infusions my condition worsened and I resigned from my bus driver job due to neck movement restriction. Now back on state medical ACHHS, I'm back on Remicade, just had my 2nd infusion, but this time with a cough that I'm not sure was caused by Remicade, time will tell. Overall Remicade is as close to a miracle as it can get."

The first two Infusions got rid of the flu like symptoms and the horrible aching pain throughout my body. The third Infusion got rid of the same symptoms, except I do feel knee and back pain still due to damage done to those areas from arthritis. I felt the back and knee pain after the first two Infusions too.  I didn't realize how sick I was until I felt better. The last time I didn't feel like I had the flu all the time, was 32 years ago! I thank God for Remicade! It's a miracle drug. I have absolutely zero side effects too! I give it a 20 on a scale of 1 to 10!"
87,Remicade (infliximab) for Crohn's Disease,1,There should be a class action lawsuit against Remicade. After 9 months' being on it for Crohn's I developed drug induced Lupus. I was in my 30's and felt like I was 90. I couldn't get out of a chair. My hands curled up and I had to get shots in my back and hands. This drug nearly killed me. My Dr kept pushing me to his physician's assistant and wouldn't see me.

Must say quite effective, HOWEVER, about 3 1/2 years into it got Shingles of the eye and subsequent post-herpetic neuralgia (and there's still some itching almost five years later).  Then August of 2017 got cellulitis in the right arm, a very painful infection requiring a seven day stay in the hospital on antibiotics followed by a week long IV administration at home. Once I was better, I have stopped the Remicade and so long as I am enjoying the remission I'll never return to it. My GI doc has suggested Entyvio but I most likely wouldn't even do that.

I’m am also still taking azothioprine as a precaution so that my body doesn’t build immunity to the infliximab. It took about 3-4 months for it to work. Prior to taking it I had suffered a particularly bad 2 year flare, lost 35kg, hospitalisation, brought my marriage to the brink and I was contemplating the unthinkable. I can’t help crying as I write this as I remember what it was like. Reaching that point, it was worth the potential risks with the hope of being normal again. As I enter my third year of infusions, I am aware that the drugs effectiveness can wear off and I am praying it doesn’t.

My infusions were every 8 weeks and could take anything up to 4 hours but my remission time between infusions began to steadily decrease.

Severe joint pain,  sore throat, swallowing face and hand and fever.  In the matter of 3 hours I was in so put pain and could’t move. Worse experience ever.  For insurance companies  it cost way less than remicade but I am not putting my self in risk and getting the second injection"
97,"Remicade (infliximab) for Crohn's Disease, Maintenance",4,"I first had symptoms when I was 17 yrs old.  Was not diagnosed until I was 25 during an exploratory surgery to find out what was wrong with me.  I am now 67, have had three surgeries, 2 for blockages and a variety of meds.. This last surgery did not go well and my crohn's became worse.  The doctor recommended I go on Remicade.  Have had three treatments with no improvement, extremely exhausted.  During my treatments I developed chest pains, had an angiogram, everything fine.  Then became very short of breath, fever  and got water on the heart from the procedure.  Will be discussing this with the doctor and requesting I stop the treatments.  I have not had a rewarding experience with Remicade.  Not sure what my options are going forward."
98,Remicade (infliximab) for Ulcerative Colitis,6,"I've been on remicade for four months, not very long I guess. After being in the hospital for a couple days I noticed almost immediate improvement after my first dose, and over the course of the next 4 months had good and bad days, mostly good until this past week. They increased my dosage to every 4 weeks. But even this whole last week. I've been in a major flare, I get my next dose tomorrow and I'm hoping it works and everything will get back on track until the next dose. I never understand whats going on. All I eat is chicken and carrots or squash everyday. I just want it to work regularly and I want a normal life again :("
99,Remicade (infliximab) for Crohn's Disease,1,I was on this for about 3 months and I felt awful almost every time after an infusion I ended up in the hospital. I decided it wasn't for me even though my Dr tried to force it on me.  I now have rheumatoid arthritis and a constant cough. I don't advise this drug.
100,"Remicade (infliximab) for Crohn's Disease, Maintenance",9,I am 22 years old  and have had Crohn's disease since age 17. I can't take steriods of any type - makes me go crazy. Remicade is the best drug I've been on for my disease. It works great but has some bothering side effects for me but they are not bad enough to quit gettting this medication every 8 weeks at the hospital through I.V. It takes about 2 or 3 hours for the treatment to be over.
101,Remicade (infliximab) for Ulcerative Colitis,3,"Initially helped me for around 1 1/2 years, then began to lose its potency, and last two treatments had bad reaction night of treatment.  More important platelet count went from normal to around 45,000.  No longer taking Remicade and my platelet count is normal now."
102,Remicade (infliximab) for Ulcerative Colitis,10,Diagnosed in 2003 with ulcerative colitis. Started Remicade in 2010. Helped my symptoms but developed Discoid Lupus in 2015. Doctor thinks it was brought on by the Remicade. Stopped Remicade and now taking Entyvio for colitis and plaquenil for the lupus.
103,Remicade (infliximab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,4,"I went on Remicade after Humira not working for my Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS). I am 60 years old. I was diagnosed with AS in 2017. I had the symptoms for many years before getting diagnosed correctly. Many women are misdiagnosed with Fibromyalgia. I had the Remicade infusions due to Medicare not covering any of the other biologics. I had 4 infusions of the drug. Each time I felt unwell 3-4 days after getting the infusion. After the last infusion the bottoms of my feet because seriously red, sore, painful and peeling. The doctor said it was a reaction from the Remicade. Then I started to have Eczema on both of my arms and feet. I am still struggling with side effects from this drug. Now I have the AS symptoms along with not feeling well at all. I would not recommend taking this drug. It's is a biological med and my elderly body obviously could not handle it. Never would I take this drug again!"
104,"Remicade (infliximab) for Crohn's Disease, Maintenance",1,"After being diagnosed with Crohns, I took two (2) Remicade infusions I believe it was only two, (2) .  My condition deteriorated quickly.  I  lost forty pounds (40), the last ten (10 pounds I lost took only ten (10) days.  

I had a Prometheus Study done and it showed no trace (0) of Remicade in my system,

How is that possible?  Has anyone else had this to happen?"
105,Remicade (infliximab) for Ulcerative Colitis,2,"After losing a substantial amount of weight and blood, in the hospital for a week two transfusioins.  diagnosed as Pan Colitis / Ulcerative Colitis.  60 mg Prednizone and the bleeding stopped at day 5. I returned home and was pressured by my GI to accept Remicade. I was skeptical but sold myself on the fact of the huge numbers of folks it helps. After two succesfull infusions I was set up for my third of which I expereinced an allergic reaction in this order, itchy palms , itchy feet , itchy everywhere, needed bowel movement , almost fainting , fever, chills and tightening of throat. Once home extreme right leg pain, hand joint pain, loss of hair. (Serum sickness) now on Balsalazide , cautious diet  and cannabis nightly & 6 months no issues"
106,Remicade (infliximab) for Ulcerative Colitis,4,"Have had Ulcerative Colitis for 4 years.  3 years ago started Remicade at 5ml per Kilo, with only mild help. Only other choice was surgery. Switched Doctor who immediately doubled dose to 10ml (which I think is the normal dose) so I probably was under-medicated for 2 years. However higher dose has not helped much more.  Have had almost no side effects. One allergic reaction early on to the infusion.  Only minor problem is the skin on my hands and arms seems very thin and very easily bleeds from the slightest scratch.  So for me it has not worked as hoped. "
107,"Remicade (infliximab) for Crohn's Disease, Maintenance",10,"I was diagnosed with Crohn's disease ten years ago. I had a flare-up six months ago. I had a small bowel resection two months ago. So far I have had five transfusions. At first I felt a little faint and scared. Now it feels fine.  

I feel great and am in remission.  I supplement my Remicade transfusions with 50 mg Imuran and B-12 shot monthly.

I am very happy.  I hope the good times last."
108,Remicade (infliximab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,4,"I have Ankylosing Spondylitis. I was given Remicade IV infusion 3 times. It helped a little with the stiffness in my SI joints and lower back. After each infusion I felt like I had the flu for about 4 days.  After the 3rd infusion the bottoms of my feet became red with a rash and were burning, painful and itching. Now 3 weeks later both of the bottoms of my feet are numb. No one can tell me anything except perhaps its a side effect of getting ""chemotherapy"". I will not take it again!"
109,Remicade (infliximab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,5,"I started remicade in 2010 and stopped remicade in 2016, almost seven years it worked absolute wonders for me. Amazing for my  Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), my arthritis started when I was a baby and I am now 25 year old female. Within the first year I developed psoriasis, who cares right? I can walk, I can actually bend my knees, zero pain. I started doing UVB light therapy and my psoriasis has not been back. 2016 I developed what I first thought was heat rash. Turned out after months and months of pain, swelling, terrible rash all over my legs that I had developed hypersensitivity leukocytoclastic vasculitis. A listed rare, severe side effect which immediately had my doctor taking me off of remicade. Giving remicade a 5 because it worked for me but couldn't continue."
110,Remicade (infliximab) for Behcet's Disease,9,"I have been taking Remicade for approxim ately one year now and find it works quite well for my Behcets symptoms.  Things were great during the initial phase of loading doses but I found once my treatments were scheduled for every eight weeks, I seemed to experience a flare before my next session (Around the 5 or 6 week period).  My doctor has just increased the treatments to every four weeks and we are hoping this will get rid of my flares all together.  The only side effect of the Remicade that I have experienced is fatigue following the infusion."
111,Remicade (infliximab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,,"I feel very tired all the time, am house bound due to fatigue and pain. I also have Ankolysing Spondylitis. I’m due for my third 8 weeks treatment next week. It also makes my moods labile in the first week after treatment. I’m 62 years old, unable to work. I’m hoping for things to get better soon."
112,Remicade (infliximab) for Crohn's Disease,10,"I have Crohn's. Had symptoms when I was 2 years old, but was misdiagnosed for 5 years. I was officially diagnosed at age 7. I tried a lot of medicines as a child, but when I got a blockage located where the small and large intestines meet, it was time for Remicade or surgery. At that time, Remicade was new. My parents made the best choice and chose Remicade. I was 12 when I started and been on it for 11 years. Yes, it's longer than I should be on it, but I was finally given a life. My intestines look like I've never had Crohn's. There were side effects and over the years they increased. Now my body has gotten used to the Remicade, at age 23, and has spread to 3 of the 4 saliva glands in my mouth, blisters in mouth/throat, and facial swelling. Other than these beauty flaws, my gut looks great! Long story short, my antibodies are fighting the Remicade and I must face my fear and try something new."
113,Remicade (infliximab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,6,"I have been on Remicade since April after not getting any relief from Inbrel or Humira.

The initial relief was wonderful, but the results since then have been very unreliable.  I find that the week before my infusion is due, I am in terrible pain all over again.  I also have a hard time with the methotrexate, it makes my stomach very upset and wipes me out the day I have to take it."
114,Inflectra (infliximab) for Crohn's Disease,10,"After being on oral medications the first three years after being diagnosed with Crohn’s, I was put on Inflectra after developing a fistula. I have been on Inflectra for two years now. It has worked wonders! Life is normal again with no more fistula problem and only a one-week flare-up resolved with next dosage of Inflectra. Inflectra is less expensive than other similars, but that doesn’t make it bad."
115,Remicade (infliximab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,3,Remicade just isn't working for me or not yet.  When I did my 1 and 2 infusions I could tell a difference.  I had my 3 on and  have to wait 8 weeks.  After 3 weeks I had a flare up and I am in week 6 and I still feel awful.  Maybe I need them more frequently or a higher dose.  I am feeling  so darn frustrated.  I was hoping for a miracle drug to make me feel better and so far it's not.  I read how it helps everyone but I want that for me too!  Can't wait to see my dr so we can get  ask up and the pain
116,"Remicade (infliximab) for Crohn's Disease, Maintenance",,"I am 23 years old and have had Crohn's since I was 19. I started Remicade about 6 months ago, and it's the only treatment that's worked so far. It is a bit time consuming, but it's better than taking 10 pills a day (or more) and more effective. I would recommend trying this after everything else fails. It feels good to be normal again."
117,Remicade (infliximab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,2,"Like some RA people, diagnosed easily back in 1990. Genetically ""gifted"" it from maternal side. 
Having tried all the old first line drugs w/o success I started on second line of meds including Enbrel. It was great for 6 months. Then it stopped. Remicade was started & after one infusion I had a horrible reaction: Serum Sickness"" . Paralyzed for 3 days, severe allodynia (pain all over). Would never take this drug. It was the mouse protein in Remicade that I reacted to. Wish you all well!"
118,Remicade (infliximab) for Ulcerative Colitis,7,I was diagnosed wit Ulcerative Colitis 3 years ago after being on several different meds for it. My doc and I decided to try Remicade.. it works fine I think but the side effect for me was diarrhea. Plus the cost I just couldn't afford it any longer. I am back on Asacol.
119,Remicade (infliximab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,9,"I've been on Remicade a long time. Spanning 19 years, but with one year of Humira due to a coverage problem and one awful year trying Xeljanz at the urging of my now-former MD. I was happy to return to Remicade. 
It's not perfect, but it keeps me controlled most of the time."
120,Renflexis (infliximab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,9,After using Remicade for years I switched to Renflexis because it had better insurance coverage. Renflexis has worked remarkably well for me. The Remicade kept my AS under control but I would get random temporary swelling in my hands and knees which is not happening with Renflexis
121,Remicade (infliximab) for Crohn's Disease,4,I was on Remicade for five years and the Crohn's Disease went into remission BUT it did a number on my immune system.  I got staph infection and eventually a septic hip.  Had to have hip surgery which consisted of a spacer for 6 months as well as medication through a pic line.  In hospital for three and a 1/2 months and nearly another 3 months at home before I was in condition to have a hip replacement.  I also have kidney disease which is partly due to medications I took while fighting Crohn's disease.  Just waiting to die and get these diseases over with.   Really consider the side effects of Remicade - septic hip was not mentioned.
122,Remicade (infliximab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,"I’ve had RA since 1981 with no relief from any of the drugs on the market at that time, e.g. gold injections, Plaquenil, Penicilamine, all NSAIDS, high dose methotrexate, prednisone etc. In 2001, I started Remicade with low dose methotrexate. It has changed my life. Within the first 4 doses, my fatigue disappeared. I have had no new joints involved for the past 20 years. I’ve had no side effects from Remicade. The only thing the medication hasn’t done is repair the damaged joints! That’s taken surgeries and joint replacements. I am very grateful for the benefits from Remicade."
123,Remicade (infliximab) for Ulcerative Colitis,4,"I was diagnosed with pan UC 2 years ago. My doctor gave me different medication that didn't work for me and made me worse. I lost 20 pounds in two weeks and didn't eat or drink anything because I would go to the bathroom ten times a day.  My doctor finally recommended remicade,  symptoms went down and a year later I've started flaring up again. They increased dosage and I get it every month now. But while I'm writing this my flare ups started again and it's been two weeks of bleeding and my doctor is on vacation. I don't know to do next, I don't want to have surgery."
124,Remicade (infliximab) for Ulcerative Colitis,2,"I was diagnosed with UC in my late 20s and never had to take anything heavy like Remicade. In my late 40s now and for the past 3 months, I've been upgraded to severe UC. Was put on Remicade and just finished my 2nd round. So far, I have not seen major results. Very discouraged! I want to change my diet and I'm trying but I also have 3 kids and its hard to change everything completely and have them eat what I eat. Does anyone know if this medication works? How long should I give it?"
125,Humira (adalimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,1,"This drug should be taken off the market.  My daughter had the Rheumatoid Arthritis and had been taking Methotrexate along with other drugs.  She was diagnosed with the Arthritis when she was in her early twenties, out of college.  She started taking Humira last year, about 6 months into it.  She died April 18, 2020.  All organs in her body had been compromised by this drug.  She was 32 years old.  When you take this, you are gambling with your life."
126,Humira (adalimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,"I was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis in 1974. I was then 24 years old.
Over the years I have been prescribed many different medications - various anti-inflammatory tablets, gold injections, Arava, Methotrexate  etc.
I have also had surgery on my hands, elbows, feet and a replacement knee.
I had many bad periods with pain, swelling and stiffness - all the symptoms that are so well known to arthritis sufferers.
But I had some good years also when I was able to go to work.
In 2007, after a severe flare up, I was prescribed  Humira, 40mg every two weeks.
The results are amazing. I haven’t had a flare up since I started using Humira.
And apart from a bladder infection, quite rarely, I have had no problems.
This year, now 2019, I will be on Humira 12 years and I think it is very good."
127,Humira (adalimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,"Humira gave me my life back! I received four different diagnosis by four different Rheumatologists. Diagnosis: Fibromalagia, Connective Tissue Disease,  Rheumatoid Arthritis, lastly Lupus. I used to have severe joint pain, mostly in my legs, difficulty walking long distances, inflammation, insomnia, depression, 60lb weight gain from steroids, stomach bloating, joint stiffness throughout the night, I would toss and turn throughout the night due to the stiff achey joint pain. My legs were the most achey, I would cry at night because the pain was so unbearable. I hated when it was time for bed, because I knew pain would accompany sleep with stiffness. I felt like I was 90 years old. I was a""Hot Mess!"" Thank GOD for Humira!!"
128,Humira (adalimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,1,My Father started Humira and within 7 months was diagnosed with Lymphoma (cancer).  He had an abdominal CT prior to starting Humira and there was no growth or mass.  A CT scan was done 7 months after starting Humira and he had a massive abdominal growth and diagnosed with Large B Cell diffuse Lymphoma.  His Rheumotologist and Oncologist both said to stop the Humira immediately and his Lymphoma was caused by Humira.  He is currently on Hospice.  Please be advised that Humira absolutely does cause Lymphoma in many people and is a dangerous medication.
129,Humira (adalimumab) for Hidradenitis Suppurativa,,"Hello,

I want to share with you all that I had hydradentitis under my both arms for 2 year and I completely cured it with elimination diet. My problem was potatoes from the night shade vegetables. You can search for elimination diet in google and learn how it works. Don't forget about the Nightshades: potatoes, eggplants, peppers, and tomatoes. I am 100% sure that elimination diet will help you get rid of this disease and you will be free from it forever. God bless."
130,Humira (adalimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,9,"At age 52 I began to experience symptoms (swelling, joint pain). After suffering for two months, I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis in Feb, 2019. Was put on prednisone for a few weeks and then began weekly dose of methotrexate. After a few months of this treatment, my symptoms were slowly improving when my doctor decided to start me on Humira. I immediately began to feel better. Well enough to resume living my active lifestyle which includes running 40+ miles a week. Thankfully, any side effects have been minimal to date."
131,Humira (adalimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,1,"My Father went on Humira for rheumatoid arthritis.  He was diagnosed with non Hodgkins lymphoma 6 months later and his rheumatolgist took him off Humira immediately.  His rheumatologist admitted that Humira caused the Lymphoma.  My father died a few months later. 
There is a black box warning that Humira may cause Lymphoma.  This drug should be taken off the market!
I tried calling the FDA and sent letters and information.
No Response from the FDA!"
132,Humira (adalimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,"Diagnosed with sero negative rheumatoid arthritis about five years ago.  It came on very quickly and pain was awful. Took methotrexate, but was quite ill from side effects.  Thought I Achieved remission and stopped methotrexate. Unfortunately, the disease was active and recently had a flare that has lasted for months. Blood work all negative. Rheumatologist ordered an MRI and found bone erosion in the wrists.  Started Humira and had relief of symptoms shortly after.  Just took second injection.  The nurse who instructed me on the shots said to leave it out of refrigerator for 30 minutes, ice the site and inject.  I have done both injections in my stomach with no pain.  Using the Humira pen.  Also iced spot for 5 minutes afterwards"
133,Humira (adalimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,"I am 47 years of age and was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis at 28. I have been incapacitated every day since my diagnosis and for the last 3 - 5 years I have had difficulty driving, walking, shopping and leading a 'normal' life. This has led to a poor quality of life due to constant pain and depression. I started taking Humira about 8 weeks ago. One week after commencing I woke up feeling very strange. It took me a few hours to work out I was completely pain free. I hope it continues to be effective. It has changed my life completely."
134,Humira (adalimumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,1,"Any negative Ankylosing Spondylitis experience I had before taking Humira was heaven compared to the awfulness Humira has caused me.  There were zero positives for me while taking Humira.  Even though I quit Humira awhile ago, all of the negative symptoms Humira caused still continue on. Now I have Ankylosing Spondylitis.... + daily headaches, extreme fatigue, constantly feel like I have the flu, way more back pain than before, constant vertigo, and psoriasis all over my scalp and jawline!  I vomit a little bit in my mouth every time I see one of those ridiculous Humira commercials on TV.

Humira was free for me thanks to the Canadian government and my insurance.  I can’t imagine actually paying for this horrible drug. My heart goes out to anyone in the US that must pay out of pocket to play Russian roulette with their health by trying Humira.  I wouldn’t use Humira again if someone paid me a million dollars!  Absolutely the worst experience of my life."
135,Humira (adalimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,3,"I had sudden onset acute rheumatoid arthritis at age 58. Severe pain, swelling, unable to work or do much of anything. Rheumatologist put me on Humira after trying various other therapies. Was taking Methotrexate, but that started causing chest pain. The Humira was like magic for a while - the pain was much diminished. I was able to go back to work and resume very active lifestyle. After about 1 1/2 years, the side effects started. Rash at first, then a plaque-like rash with sloughing skin (which is still spreading) on my head, hands. Then boils started - very large, very slow to heal. I have to stop taking it - it is killing my immune system. Really not sure how much damage has been done to my body from this drug. There are significant risks to this drug."
136,Humira (adalimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,9,"I had rheumatoid arthritis onset literally overnight in wrist, and within short period, all fingers, elbows and shoulders.  I have negative RF, but elevated Sed Rate.  I pushed my Rheumatologist hard to get in front of the disease progression. I was on Methotrexate alone for about 10 wks, increasing dosage from 12.5mg - 17.5mg but it had marginal impact. I pushed for Humira and within 48 hrs after first injection, I noticed improvement.  I'm six weeks into combination therapy and I'd say I'm 60-70% improved.   Large joints are 90% better but fingers remain stubborn.  Yes, the shot hurts for 10 flipping seconds.  I let it get to room temp for about 30-40 minutes..speciality pharmacist said that was fine.  This medicine is awesome."
137,Humira (adalimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,7,"At 23 my RA got so bad that walking & lifting my hands over my head was enough to make me wince in pain.

Doc prescribed me Humira, and my pain went away overnight (literally).

I continued taking it for a year, and I haven't had a single notable flare-up since the first injection. I still get random SMALL aches but they're completely forgetabble.

Can't say the list of long-term side effects don't scare me. So since I feel 100%, I've decided I no longer want it. Have actually been off the med for about 6 months now and not a single flare-up.

Doc pressured me to mix it with Methotrexate, but I'm not a human test subject so that ain't happening. Doctors, please listen to your patients. If they feel great, don't force MORE meds on them."
138,Humira (adalimumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,9,"I am 32, and as a child I was incredibly active.  Around the age of 20 I started showing signs of AS, and was constantly in and out of the Drs, begging to be looked at- they shrugged me off as making it up, fibromyalgia, endometriosis, diabetes- it wasn't until at 25 I was completely incapable of turning my head & had trouble walking that someone took me serious.  A specialist discovered I had AS.  I only started Humira in Dec of 2015, a 40mg dose every 14 days.  The morning after I woke up and just lay there in shock- I hadn't felt like this since I was just a kid.  I sat up in bed and just sobbed.  I am so thankful for Humira every single day.  I walk everywhere, I can skip up the steps- my neck may be permanently frozen, but I am hopeful"
139,Humira (adalimumab) for Psoriasis,,It was hard for my mom to find a Dermatoligist in my area to start me on Humira because I was 14 years old. I was covered from head to toe and my fingernails and toenails were so thick and painful. I had been suffering since the age of 3 and we had tried everything known to Physicians and man. Finally a Dermatologist started me on two 40 mg shots per month. BAM! I was completely clear in 2 months. And I can honestly and whole-heartedly say that Humira has given me my life. I am now a thriving 16 year old 10th grader. My grades have dramatically improved. I can write without pain. I can walk and wear shoes without pain. I had never worn a pair of shorts to school and now I wear shorts and swim. Humira was a miracle for me and my family.
140,Humira (adalimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,1,"I've had RA, after a bout of health issues, and finding out I had Pulmonary Fibrosis (PF),  from unknown causes.  I guess the shock and complications from a lung biopsy pushed my body over the edge.
I was started on Prednisone and Sulfasalazine, but got minimal relief. Due to the PF,  doctors were reluctant to try biological drugs. 
I did try Orencia, but had side effects.  Was placed on Enbrel, but no Relief.  I finally got Humira. I took the first dose and felt strange the next day; panicked.  By the next day my life was in utter chaos! I did find that if you're on Benzos, it blocks them, so I was in total withdrawal!!! I had to research that one.
4 weeks later I'm dealing with horrible headaches, depression, vertigo, tinnitus...I just pray this med gets out of my system soon! I read it may take 88-98 days to clear! Never again! No more Biological meds!
Prayers for all who are suffering!"
141,Humira (adalimumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,10,"It has been about a year for me taking Humira. I was actually quite concerned before starting it as I read all sorts of reviews claiming stuff like getting cancer and such and I almost didn't take the drug out of fear. Having suffered from Anklylosing Spondylitis for a better part of 15 years and trying everything from different kinds of pain killers, muscle relaxants, chiropracters to months of physio therapy, I had just learned to live with back pain and dreaded it every morning. 

Humira has been a miracle drug for me so far. I haven't had any pain whatsoever since the first two weeks of starting it. Blood work is all normal and haven't had any reactions or side effects other than some redness on the area where I inject it. The pain from injecting was also way exaggerated in the reviews. It is a little painful but 5-10 secs of light pain is nothing compared to the relief it provides."
142,Humira (adalimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,8,"l have had rheumatoid arthritis now for 7 years, it runs in my family both grandmothers, my parents, my 5 siblings. I have been taking methotrexate injections for 2 years plus Celebrex & Plaquenil along with controlled pain medication. I thought is this the way my life is going to be, always in pain. I started Humira about 3 weeks ago & WOW after the 1st injection the next day I could not believe how much my pain and stiffness had decrease, I could actually get up by myself in the morning. I take my shot every 2 weeks, I start noticing about the Friday or Saturday a little stiffness and feeling achy and know its time for the next dose. 
I have experienced a lot of pain, burning & stinging on the injection site. I have learned what works for me is to lie down."
143,Humira (adalimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,"I take Humira for rheumatoid arthritis and so far it's the only medicine that works for me. I've tried Plaquenil and methotrexate but they don't even touch the pain/swelling.  I began to feel relief the morning after the first shot of Humira. Don't let the instructions scare you. The shot is not painful. I let it stand on the counter 15 minutes before I give it so it's not so cold. My Doctor suggested that I sit in a straight back chair so that the abdominal area is already pinched and you'll have both hands free, then pick a spot on my stomach that's 2 inches away from the navel and just do as the directions explain. You won't feel the needle, but the medication will burn just a little.  I can't even say it hurts. Don't be afraid."
144,Humira (adalimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,"My mother was taking this drug  twice monthly. She had been on it once before for aut  2 years and had great results. She had to stop because of an operation. Later on her arthritis caused so much pain and she requested this medicine again. She took it again for 3 months and was so happy to be able to get around. She then got scratched by her dog, took the shot and by the next morning she had a 104 fever and infection spread throughout her body. She went into a coma state and never came out of it. She died from septic shock 6 days later. Use with extreme caution. Do not use if you even get a scratch or sore as it lowers your immune system and may cause death from an infection."
145,Humira (adalimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,"I was against taking this medication until my flare-ups were so bad I was not able to walk or use my arm.
I am so grateful for this medication. I just had my 3rd dose (every other week). Other than the extreme pain during the shot and a bit unsettled for about 10 minutes after, I say this medication is a miracle.  I am 99.75% pain free ~ the first time in over a year.  So far no side effects other than very thirsty.  Cutting down on coffee and have increased my water intake.  I worry about possible future side effects but not being able to move is not living."
146,Humira (adalimumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,9,"I have been on weekly doses of Humira for 5 years now. My Ulcerative Colitis (UC) is very much under control. People need to realize that not all drugs work for everyone. I am lucky Humira has worked for me. The only side effects I have are constant runny nose, mild stomach aches and minor joint pain, which can actually be from the U.C and not necessarily the Humira. For those that find the injections painful, I suggest you let the pen warm up for 20 minutes before you do your injection. I don't like taking any meds, but when you have no options, being on Humira is a much better than  having severe U.C. symptoms all day and night."
147,Humira (adalimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,"I was initially put on Humira a couple years ago for my RA, after a failed attempt with using Enbrel and Methotrexate to treat my constantly inflamed and achy joints. I am pleased to report that with only 6 or so months with using Humira, it launched me into an incredible 2 year remission where I was completely pain free and had my life back. I knew it would be short lived, about 2 months ago some of the aches and inflammation started to come back. I told my Rheumy I wanted back on Humira so she gave me an injection and I took it last week. The arthritis was getting nasty before taking the injection and literally within not even 24 hours of my first injection, SYMPTOMS WERE GONE!! Humira works quickly and effectively!!"
148,Humira (adalimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,1,"I was diagnosed with RA  (rheumatoid arthritis) about 4 years ago and my rheumatologist started me on Xeljanz and it was a miracle drug. I was 100% pain free. Unfortunately after a few years it wasn’t working anymore and she decided to start me on Humira and Methotrexate which isn’t doing anything for me. I’ve been on the Humira and Methotrexate for about 2 months now and I’m so discouraged because I’m not getting any relief at all. My feet are swollen, burning, and I can hardly walk. I think I’m going to continue this for another month and if nothing I’m going to talk to my doctor about a different medication."
149,"Humira (adalimumab) for Crohn's Disease, Maintenance",8,My husband has had a severe case of Chron's since he was 33. He was on and off of Remicade for 7 years. Last January we found out he built up antibodies to the Remicade and it was no longer working properly.  Humira has been a God send for him. He loves that he decides when to give himself the shot and he only has side effects for 24 hours compared to 48 or 72 hours after an infusion of Remicade. He has been in remission for a year for the first time in years. We feel very blessed there is a new medicine helping patients with this very difficult disease. He also has learned to eliminate gluten and dairy. As his diet gets better he feels better.
150,Humira (adalimumab) for Psoriasis,10,"I have had psoriasis since I was 5 years old, today I am 63 years old.  When I started to take the Humira injections about a 1 1/2 years ago I was a little afraid of the results.  I had not been clear since the age of 5 so I was in doubt that this would clear my body. But shortly after taking the injections my psoriasis went away and I am still clear today.  It has been so wonderful not to have to wear long sleeves and long pants for the first time in my life.  Thank you Humira for helping me.  This has been a miracle for me!"
151,Humira (adalimumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,8,"Was diagnosed with AS my last year in the Navy. My back was so bad that I could not walk normally (I had to walk like I had something shoved up my butt). They put me on Humira and I felt immediate relief. I was able to walk normally and even began running again. It’s been 5 years now, and I’ve gotten many colds but nothing serious. It allows mobility, which alleviates the pain. On no other meds so far besides acid reflux medicine. Very thankful, but still scared after every blood test. My quality of life has improved greatly."
152,Humira (adalimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,"When my doctor first suggested humira 14 years ago, I was afraid to start it. I've had juvenile arthritis since I was 15, and am now 50. I was so used to pain, that I didn't remember what it was like to be pain free, that is until I finally decided to try humira. I figured what do I have to lose. I won't know if it works if I don't try it. Honestly, within hours of my first injection I could feel a difference. It really was a miracle drug for me. It lasted 14 years, when it just started losing its efficacy for me. I have learned through research, that your body can produce antibodies to the medicine. Unfortunately when that happens, the medicine will no longer work. I'm going to now have to try something else"
153,Humira (adalimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,1,I've been on Humira for 4 months now and the wide spread of pain and respiratory symptoms have been a nightmare. My rheumatologist stopped the Humira because she too had never seen such a bad reaction.
154,Humira (adalimumab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,10,"I suffered from psoriasis for about 5 years and then started with severe pain in my fingers, then my wrist, elbows, shoulders, knees, and finally my toes. I had no idea what was wrong with me and I literally thought I was dying. I was only 46 years old.  I was finally diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis. I started Humira and within 2 weeks I was pain free and have been since. I have been on Humira for over 2 years now. I have not suffered from any side effects at all. Humira also cleared up my skin about 90%, and the only symptom I still have from the PA is the fatigue. Before Humira I could not throw football with my kids or catch a football I was in so much pain, now I can throw ball, ride bike, play basketball whatever I want to do."
155,Humira (adalimumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,10,"I'm not one for hyperbole but genuinely think its a miracle.
I've just had a proper good sneeze. Full inhalation, full 'James Brown' ""Owwww!"" At the end.
First time in over a year not been halted mid-sneeze by the pain of the inhalation or having had to control the sneeze to a mild 'heeewwwwww-Ouch'
Sounds ridiculous to those who've never felt that way, but in addition to the normal yada-yada-yada of  being able to stand up and walk etc a proper sneeze or laugh or cough is priceless."
156,Humira (adalimumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,10,"Was on Remicade for over a year, which cleared the ulcerative colitis within a few weeks. However within two weeks after the Remicade I started having arthritis systems that got so severe I was taking Vicodin every 4 hours and still unable to sleep, or just do usual chores around the house. My hands were so swollen, I couldn't use them. Finally Dr. decided to try Humira every 2 weeks. I have gone back to doing most of my chores, walking the dogs and my hands are no longer swollen. I am starting to feel like a normal person again. Have only had three injections, which sting like the dictions for a few minutes but it is worth it not to be in pain all the time. I hope this continues."
157,Humira (adalimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,"I had my first shot two weeks ago, and my second last Monday.  It worked immediately for me.  I was able to sleep through the night that first night, after many months of pain and trouble sleeping.  I have had active symptoms for about 8 months.  I also take methotrexate and Diclofenac.  I am in amazement how great I feel!  No side effects yet.  I'm getting great sleep and can play tennis again.  I don't like the injections, but I feel so good... It's worth it!"
158,Humira (adalimumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,9,"Dear all,
I am a 26 year old Dutch man who has been living with AS since 18, but got diagnosed just 4 years ago at 22. Because Humira is so expensive they made me use NSAID's like diclofenac and naproxen for two years. Before I used humira I dropped out of college, couldn't do any sports and was bed ridden most of the day. If I would for instance do the dishes, I would be broken for the rest of the day. A little over two years ago they started me on Humira and it has completely changed my life. I was very wary of the medicine because it involves shooting yourself up and I was hesitant as I had just taken these heavy painkillers which did not benefit me at all. I couldn't walk and now I play football three times a week and am back to work/uni"
159,Humira (adalimumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,10,"My first injection was friday. By sunday morning i felt like a weight was lifted off my shoulders. I felt no pain. NONE! As someone that is on their feet for 12 hours a day, i cant believe i can come home and play with my daughter again without wincing in pain and struggling to function after 7pm. This is a miracle. The price of this drug is frustrating and i hope that may change over time, but if that is the price to pay to feel well, ill deal with it. I hope this was informative."
160,Humira (adalimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,I began HUMIRA after 3 years of minimal control of my rheumatoid arthritis.  I take methotrexate in addition.  I am shocked at the quick control of my symptoms and am so happy that I am feeling so much better.  I do have some headache and dizziness the next day....but it is sooooo worth it.  I highly recommend the self injections vs. the auto inject.....there was a serious reduction in pain with the self injection.
161,Humira (adalimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,,"I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis in 2012, at 25. After an allergic reaction to methotrexate, I was put on leflunomide with great success for a short while.  Unfortunately for me, my rheumatoid arthritis has affected every joint in my body.  Every flare up is different, but everything hurts at some point.  I seeked a second opinion and was immediately prescribed Humira.  Like many others, I was given the pen.  I must say that the suspense leading up to pushing that button is far worse than the 15 or so seconds of pain.  I was given a sample fresh from the fridge at my appointment, and it hurt like hell.  My nurse shared with me to let it come to room temp.  I do my first at-home injection next week. Hoping for great results."
162,Humira (adalimumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,10,I usually would have a mild flare once a year. 2018 was the worst year for me EVER. I was so sick so I was originally put on remicade... I had lots of side effects and eventually built up antibodies. Then I started Humira <3 I do the pen! The shots don’t hurt at all (I do them in my stomach) I take 40mgs every two weeks. I’ve been on humira for a few months and I can say I’m 100% UC symptom free!!! Which I’ve never been able to 100% say before. Thank you Humira for saving my colon and giving me my life back!!!
163,Humira (adalimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,8,"Diagnosed RA 2012 tried many meds then prescribed Humira.   Worked well for RA but everyday I was getting weaker and weaker. 

Caused my vitamin d deficiency and also Mono.   To top it all I now have lymphoma.  Please watch your vitamin d levels.  Also I have kidney stones.  Tough go trying to get just comfortable."
164,"Humira (adalimumab) for Crohn's Disease, Maintenance",9,"Humira has really been a life saver. I wasn't sure if I was going to see another day in my life without pain and then I was introduced to Humira..it truly is a blessing, I don't have any side effects from the shot at all."
165,"Humira (adalimumab) for Crohn's Disease, Maintenance",10,"Diagnosed with Crohn's 15 years ago.  Medicine varied with poor results for 9 years. Over 60% of my colon is bad.  Prescribed Humira 6 years ago.  On Humira I have recovered and stayed in remission.  I have had no negative side effects. I have been able to manage the shot every two weeks very well.  

(Previous medications, such as pentasa and prednisone, did cause significant and bad side effects along with no help for the crohn's symptoms.)"
166,Humira (adalimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,9,"HUMIRA has worked great for 4 years. Dr prescribed New Citrate free HUMIRA, been on it for 2 1/2 months. My hands are weak again, my feet hurt/burn again, I’m tired and cold all the time. I’m calling Dr to ask for script for original humira. I’ll take the little pain of original over the not helping citrate free."
167,Humira (adalimumab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,9,"I have been experiencing extreme pain since 2009 from psoriatic arthritis, tried methotrexate no luck, finally started Humira 72 hours ago and already no pain whatsoever. A lot faster than I ever expected. The injection is not bad at all, a very small needle with a slight sting, but I'll take a 5 minute sting over the pain I had any day. I have not had any side effects yet I will edit this post if I do in future. I found these post very helpful with my decision to start Humira so I though I would return the favor."
168,Humira (adalimumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,10,"I was diagnosed at 40 with Ankylosing Spondylitis and found out I am HLA- B27 positive. My pain in my back neck and ankles was unbearable at times, & the exhaustion was horrible! I quit my job of 17 years because I could no longer stand for hours anymore. After many medications that didn’t work and made me very sick.  Last week I started Humira and noticed a huge difference by the next morning. I am no longer exhausted. So for I have nothing but great things to say about Humaria. The side effects are scary, but not hurting anymore is priceless"
169,Humira (adalimumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,9,"I'm a 53 year old male, have had Ankylosing Spondylitits since I was a teenager, undiagnosed until a bout of Uveitis (inflammation in my eye) in 2010, the blood tests revealed I was HLA B27.  From there my illness steadily progressed until hospitalisation in 2016, by the end of 2016 I was having more frequent episodes of uveitis followed by debilitation reactive arthritis that left me unable to move. The last episode in Feb 2017 saw me hospitalised again, due to the pain of my ribs expanding when trying to breath. I received my first Humira injection pen injection the day after being hospitalised in Feb...... It's a miracle. Within 24 hours I was feeling better than I had felt in 8 years. Humira has given me a second chance."
170,Humira (adalimumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,10,"Just started taking humira.  I took my first shot a week ago. My life has changed completely I have no pain, I can walk normal humira gave me my life back  after 4 years of pain.  It has also helped my crohn's as well I highly recommend humira"
171,Humira (adalimumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,10,"I am 50 years old and have had UC since I was in my late 20's. I was on Remicade from 2006-2014 when it just stopped helping my symptoms. I have been hospitalized many times for UC and on the Remicade, when it was working it was wonderful. In early 2014 my symptoms returned and I felt horrible for months and that is when my Doctor prescribed Humira 40mg. every other week. I started in July of 2014 and have had NO UC symptoms at all. It has been a lifesaver. I have to have a colonoscopy every 2 years due to my UC and my last one in Jan. 2017 showed NO signs of the UC...Doc said best scan I have had in 10 years. Humira is so worth it and much easier than Remicade."
172,Humira (adalimumab) for Crohn's Disease,10,"I have been on Humira for over 1 year.  I was originally on Entocort and Pentasa and it wasn't helping.  My doctor suggested moving to Humira rather than more pills.  I started feeling better just a few days after the initial dose.  The injections do hurt, but for only about 10 seconds.  Way better then being in constant pain!  I was a little concerned about all the warnings, but I figure I am going to die someday so I might as well feel good.  I have not had any side effects.  I am so grateful for Humira!"
173,Humira (adalimumab) for Hidradenitis Suppurativa,9,"Have had Hidradenitis Suppurativa since childhood (before puberty)
Stage 2 Hurley
And...
Colitis, IBD

No pain for me when injection in tummy. 

I feel like superman for 30 min after injection. I feel great. 

It has reduced lesions every time. The more I build up in my system, the less lesions there are occurring. I’m so happy I am on this drug. 

I delayed taking the drug after reading scary reviews. I’m glad I went ahead anyway. It has been great for me."
174,Humira (adalimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,9,"I was diagnosed with RA 12 years ago at age 57. Was put on Arava with Diclofenac, Plaqunil, and Prednisone.
What a combo!  Became in-effective after a couple years. Reumy put me on Humira - BEST thing that could have happened to me.  Worked wonders and I had no side effects to speak of.  6 years ago I was taken off everything, as I had gone into COMPLETE REMISSION! I remained symptom and pain free until about 3 months ago, when my pain and symptoms re-appeared.  My doctor had retired in the mean time, and my new doctor will not put me on Humira.  Instead I'm on methotrexate, which makes me feel dizzy, headaches, and I now have anemia.  I will be seeking a new doctor who will put me back on Humira! It works!!"
175,Humira (adalimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,8,"I have been taking Humira now for about 10 years. First started as study patient and still continue to take it.  It has been great.  Recently the cost has been the biggest concern.  I have tried to take injections a month at a time rather then two weeks.  I do not suggest this.  Three weeks at a time seem to work great for me.  After that the pain starts to return.  I am currently researching other medicines so I can stop taking this.  The cost is just too high for me.  Currently the only long term affects I have noticed is shortness of breath, hair loss, occasional dizziness and fatigue/insomnia.  I hope this review helps."
176,Humira (adalimumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,10,"Took the pen injection once every 2 weeks for 4 years. Went from 18 inches from the ground vertically bending over too touching my toes. From partial flex of my neck to full flex. Still have common arthritis problem such as inflamed vertebra and joints. Humria cleared my psoriasis completely. Wonderful working medicine. I can now do many more physical things and a lot more flexable without pain or stiffness. But for warning, let the pen warm to room temperature  to reduce bruising."
177,Humira (adalimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,,"My wife just had her first shot today 2/26/2011 so we don't really have a rating yet. She was very nervous about how painful she heard it was but followed the advice of a pharmacist who told her to put an ice pack on the shot location for approximately 5 minutes before and after. It was great advice and worked well for the pain and also the bump she was told to expect. I checked the area about 10 minutes after it was all said and done and couldn't even see where the shot was given.

She also read these comments and wanted to respond to the advice about letting the drug get to room temp. Her doctor said that it is extremely important to keep it cold because the proteins will separate, rendering the medicine useless. Hope this helps."
178,Humira (adalimumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,9,"I was recently diagnosed with AS at 35, after developing severe iritis in both eyes following my hysterectomy. My inflammation was so severe, my eyes swelled shut! After rounds of testing, everything came back normal. Then my severe lower back pain, and everything that comes with AS came on fast and I got iritis back in one eye!! I could not walk, bend or sleep without crying and kept gaining weight! Finally they tested me for the gene, it came back positive. After seeing a specialist this past April, I began a variety of testing and was officially diagnosed! I started humira in May and wow, I sometimes forget I have the disease!! I lost 12 lbs in the first 2 weeks and now, not much pain. I am very thankful for this treatment and coverage!"
179,Humira (adalimumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,1,After being on Humira I  have severe from of bipolar disorder severe depression anxiety emotional instability panic attacks anger rage sadness memory issues etc a complete personality change. These symptoms creeped in slowly but worsened to the point that I was really struggling mentally in every aspect of life. It was almost like an out of body experience the way that drug effects your brain is dangerous.
180,Humira (adalimumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,10,"I had been on almost every medication and was on Prednisone for 2 years.  I was at the end of my rope and thought I'd never get better.  I reluctantly took Humira and I was so scared of giving myself shots.  After the initial loading 4 I cried.  I started out taking a shot every 2 weeks and it took me quite a while to actually depress the injector.  I have now been on Humira weekly for over a year and my life is quite different.  I am glad to get up in the morning, happy to go to work, elated to go the grocery store - all without scoping out a restroom first.  I feel alive for the first time since I was diagnosed.  I wait everyday for the Humira to quit working and I hope it doesn't.  For now I'll take what it has given me."
181,Humira (adalimumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,10,I am a 43 year old male. I have been  struggling with hip and lower back pain for about 5 years now. Been on NSAIDS for inflammation and pain. Don't really remember what a full night of rest feels like.  To be honest   I was scared to take Humira  until I done my own research. On 2-11-2015  I had my first shot of Humira.  I'm thinking this sucker is going to really hurt. Took me about 5 minutes to get my nerve up. Oh well I pushed the button and the rest is history. OMG!!!!!!!!! Why did I wait so long.  To me the shot doesn't hurt but it does sting just a little. 2 days after the shot. No pain in hips and sleeping all night. I still have some tightness in my lower back when I wake up. So far its a miracle.
182,Humira (adalimumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,9,"Severe back pain while sleeping started over a year ago... Assumed it was work related, so I started looking for a new job. Then the foot/ankle pain and joint swelling came. I was in terrible pain and could barely walk around at my new job. Finally after seeing seeing my pcp multiple times, I went to ortho. She referred my to a rheumatologist. I thought I was a healthy 30+ year old, but after 6 months of blood tests, X-Ray's  mri's and multiple follow ups... I now have the official diagnosis. I noticed an immediate difference as soon as I took Humira. I have had 3 doses And symptoms are gone... Although my feet get sore just as I'm due for the next treatment. I'm worried about the long term side effects, but for now just happy without pain."
183,Humira (adalimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,1,"I started taking Humira after the Methotrexate became in-effective.  I WOULD NEVER TAKE THIS HUMIRA AGAIN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.  It began with headaches, which got worse every time I took the Humira.  My energy level went down to nothing, and it did not help my RA at all.  NOW, this drug has given me severe Eczema on my hands, feet, underarms, crotch and in my ear canals.  I have never been so miserable in my entire life.  They can't help the eczema at all.  I have gone off Humira for over 2 months, I'm flaring, and I still have the eczema.  They tell me I might have it for life.  DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG.  I'd rather have RA pain, then all these debilitating side effects.  Funny, they never said a word about any of this."
184,Humira (adalimumab) for Crohn's Disease,10,"Have Crohn's for over 20 years, been on every drug available including Infliximab. Infliximab helped but affected the nerves in my legs and feet. Now on Humira for a year, at first the dose was one injection every two weeks which helped a bit. Now on 2 pens every 2 weeks with fantastic results. No signs of Crohn's now, only side effects are sneezing and runny nose. For me a wonderful drug."
185,Humira (adalimumab) for Psoriasis,10,I wanted to tell people about Humira. I have been on it 10days with no side effects! My scalp was 95% covered by Psoriasis. I started my first injection March 1st and today my scalp and behind my ears are clearer. The Humira pen is nothing to worry about doesn't hurt. Leave it out 30 mins and inject in your stomach easy as can be! Good luck everyone.
186,Humira (adalimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,9,"Its been a whole month since my last posting, I recently went to see my Doctor.....and guess what, NO inflammation whatsoever. But have noticed that I have had lot of sinus congestion. But who cares as long as my rheumatoid arthritis factor is @ ZERO."
187,Humira (adalimumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,10,"This is a fantastic medicine. I'm 31 years old and have struggled with back pain since being about 25. Being very tall (6'4) many of the issues were put down to my tallness. 
When the back pain started affecting my breathing I knew something more that being tall was a play. 
After a number of differing referrals, I was finally passed to a Rheumatology specialist who spotted my symptoms very quickly and suggested my treatment. It took over a month to get the test results and approvals but when I started treatment the results were within a week for me.
Now I have next to no pain and I have no real symptoms. 
The injections are uncomfortable but for 10 seconds of pain for 2 weeks of being able to move and breathe without being in pain is worth it."
188,Humira (adalimumab) for Hidradenitis Suppurativa,1,"My wife was put on humira for HS. She was taking for two months when she started to get what looked like ant bites on her hands and feet. The nurse practitioner who put her on Humira said that wasn't from Humira so she kept taking it but after her next dose it exploded and got way worse. So after doing some research myself I found out pustular psoriasis was one of the rare side effects. Here we are two months after stopping taking it and she's got all kinds of skin issues like contact dermatitis, severe pustular psoriasis which is only being controlled by steroids.  She has lost 50% of her hair. Humira has ruined our lives."
189,"Humira (adalimumab) for Crohn's Disease, Maintenance",9,"As a new Crohn's patient I had read a lot of horror stories about this disease and the medications used to control it - myself, I went on Azathioprine first but it stopped working gradually. Humira has honestly been a God send so far, I have my life back and no symptoms 99% of the time, I'm so thankful! Only thing I'm worried about now is if it stops working, but nothing has happened yet and I am past the danger zone apparently."
190,Humira (adalimumab) for Crohn's Disease,1,My husband was in humira for just over a year.  It helped with the crohns symptoms but he was constantly in hospital with infections the most serious being pneumonia.  While being treated for pneumonia they discovered his blood counts weren't right and 2 months later he was diagnosed with leukaemia.  We later found out this is one of the side effects.  On taking humira my husband signed his death warrant.  After fighting the leukaemia for 18 months my husband lost the battle.  FOLLOWING OUR EXPERIENCE I WOULD SAY STAY AWAY FROM HUMIRA
191,"Humira (adalimumab) for Crohn's Disease, Maintenance",10,"I have been taking Humira for 5 months after having had surgery for 3 fistulas. Humira has changed my life drastically. I am a senior in a high school and prior to humira I was constantly in pain and when i wasn't in pain I was worried about when i would be in pain and I had fistulas for 2 years without any surgeries. Since I have been taking Humira I almost forget i have any disease because I feel normal again. I can go out without worry and am pain free. I haven't gotten any fistulas since then either, I really can't say enough good things about Humira. Love it!!"
192,Humira (adalimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,8,"I have rheumatoid arthritis for last 7 years and was against any form of medication but living with pain day in day out and caring for new born was very hard. Before Humira I was taking 6 different tablets daily and end up putting on lots of weight. Just started Humira 6 weeks ago apart from not being able to sit on the floor and regain my life back. So far no side effects, just thirsty and fatigue when over doing. Keeping fingers cross. 

I found if you let the injection to reach room temperature it doesn't hurt that much, only the needle sting."
193,Humira (adalimumab) for Psoriasis,10,"I have been using Humira to treat my psoriatic arthritis for 12 years along with Methotrexate (currently 43 yrs old). My psoriasis (and arthritis) went away after 3 months of using them and I've never had any side effects. My doc asked me to stop using Humira to see if it was still necessary and now after 3 months my psoriasis is back. Going back to the doctors to get his approval to go back on it. It has worked perfectly for me, you just have to deal with the pain of the monthly injection, also it is very expensive if you don't have insurance."
194,Humira (adalimumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,,"I have had ankylosing spondylitis for 20 years, 45 now, was able to cope well with anti-inflammatories. Pain and mobility really started to get bad in last 5 years, last year anti-inflammatories stopped being effective, major loss of mobility, lots of pain and had to add pain killers. Started Humira and was pain free in 1 month, gained back all mobility, pain free and able to do any exercise I want without any problems. 6 months in and no side effects as yet."
195,Humira (adalimumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,10,"Humira is a miracle.  Prior to being on Humira I had tried two previous solutions NSAIDs and a non-starch diet with lots of exercise.  NSAIDs had absolutely no effect.  The non-starch diet with some exercise did help bring the pain to what I would call manageable but flares would still happen and with them would come several day cycle of poor sleep, less exercise, and so on.

My rheumatologist explained that some new research suggest Humira may actually help to stop the progression of the disease so I gave it a shot (pun, hah!).

It took about 3 weeks to start kicking in and by week 5 my symptoms were totally gone.  No back pain.  No shoulder pain.  No waking up in the middle of the night."
196,Humira (adalimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,"I started on humira a year after my diagnosis and felt better overnight.  It wasn't the pain that was doing me in it was the total lack of energy and not feeling like myself.  I finally felt normal again.  My doctor wanted me to also take methotrexate but the oral pills caused almost constant vomiting.  After my wrist problems I tried the methotrexate again with no success so was put on enbrel.  I had some minor skin infections on humira but never ran a a fever and could always be cleared up.  So after almost 3 years on humira I was switched to enbrel.  My energy plummeted, although I had no pain or flares just constant respiratory infections with fevers.  I was put on sub q meth and humira and energy returned.  I am so much happier!"
197,Humira (adalimumab) for Hidradenitis Suppurativa,1,"Unfortunately, Humira made my HS worse rather than better. It was concentrated mostly in my groin area with a few spots showing up sporadically under my arms. After injecting myself weekly for 15 months, I now have lesions that are uncontrollable in my groin and buttock area (including my outer hip area), around my breasts, traveling up my neck and head, and all around my face. I can't believe this is what I have to deal with now."
198,Humira (adalimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,8,"I've been taking humira for two years for severe rheumatoid arthritis. One 40 mg shot a week. It's worked wonders on my arthritis. I also take 15 mg methotrexate once a week. 
No side effects except for extreme mood swings from extreme anger to laughing so hard I'd 
be in tears. I thought I was going crazy until I saw comments from other people taking humira with similar side effects. Thanks to everyone for sharing your experiences .I'm not nuts after all."
199,Humira (adalimumab) for Psoriasis,1,"I’m sharing this only with the hope that it might help someone else. My daughter was started on Humira  six months ago for psoriasis. Three months in she developed what looked like a very itchy rash over her entire body. After two weeks the rash turned into what looked like psoriasis plaques. Her physician switched her to taltz.  She had some initial clearing, but it came back with a vengeance. Tried  several different types of steroid creams, but the rash continued to cover 90% of her skin  on her arms, legs, and torso. Last evening, with nothing left to lose, I smeared  Vermont’s  bag balm  all over her back, as this was the worst area. This morning when she woke up there was a noticeable (I’d say about 50%) improvement  on her back, with no change to the skin on her extremities. 
 I do not work for the company that makes the cream, And I’m not trying to sell it to anyone. I only  wish to share our experience."
200,Humira (adalimumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,10,"Prior to taking Humira, I competed in marathons, triathlons and an Ironman. Additionally, I was a swimming coach. All of a sudden, I could not walk. I spent days in the hospital with no answer. 

After one back surgery, and a second one being planned, my rheumatologist prescribed Humira after testing positive for Ankylosing Spondylitis. Within two months, I had no more back spasms, I could sneeze with out a spasm, I could stand long enough to wash dishes. I began walking normal again. It was a long two years of pain and suffering. Now taking Humira, I have my life back. I feel great!

Do know, it does 'turn off' your immune system. I found, taking a probiotic with immune support (and lots of hand washing!) it was not a problem."
201,Humira (adalimumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,10,"I was diagnosed with Ankylosing spondilitis 8 months ago at the age of 49 although I had back pain and sacroiliac joint pain for many years which seemed to be getting worse and worse. 
I started getting inflammation in my eyes about 10 years ago. (uveitis) On my orthamogist's advice, I saw a reumatologist and even though white lines appeared on my SI joints on MRI scans she was unhelpful. 
I got worse and kept self medicating. After more bouts of uveitis I went to see the reumatologist again who tested me for the HLA gene. When it came back negative, she dismissed me again until 3 years later I could no longer walk even though I had been swimming and doing Pilates. 
Humira has given me my life back after 4 months. My mobility is back."
202,"Humira (adalimumab) for Crohn's Disease, Maintenance",8,"I have been a Crohn's sufferer since I was 18, I'm now 47. I have had two bowel resections, multiple blockages and bowel symptoms that left me house bound for days at a time. I have been on Prednisone so much that I have maxed out the lifetime exposure limit, have tried Methotrexate (nausea+++), Pentasa (no change) and Remicade (serum reaction). I have been on Humira now for over 8 years and aside from a few minor flare-ups, I have a life back. Bless all of the programs and benefit companies that have recognized that this medication has restored some people to being productive once again."
203,Humira (adalimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,2,"Humira was my first medicine to try for recently diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis. Had to stop after the 2nd injection due to nausea, lethargy, my teeth hurt and had 3/4 migraines a week. Trying a new medicine now and hope to see results. Humira has a discount program that you only pay $5 for. Ask your doc about it!"
204,Humira (adalimumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,9,"I see some comments about painful injections, I had that too but I wasn't letting the medication warm up after taking it out of the refrigerator, if it warms up it's no problem. I've been on this about 4 months and I'm feeling better every week. It's awesome."
205,Humira (adalimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,8,I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis after 2 years of awful pain. I am now using Humira with methotrexate. I also take sulfasalizine antibiotic daily due to lowered immunity. I take Prilosec for heartburn. I am able to work a full time job and do most things that I enjoy.
206,"Humira (adalimumab) for Crohn's Disease, Maintenance",10,Humira gave me my life back.  I was sicker than I had ever been and this is the first medicine that consistently made me feel better.  I take it in conjunction with Pentasa which seems to be the magic formula for me.  I don't like giving myself a shot but I am so grateful for how I feel.  Diet is a big part too but this has been a miracle for me.
207,Humira (adalimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,9,"The cost is the only reason I give it a 9 star instead of 10.
I have been on Humira for about 2 months. The very next day after my first injection I could close my fingers for the first time in months, my knees bent better, and a knot on my hand disappeared. Talk about a surprise for me! I worry about long time effects of being on Humira but will figure that out later. I'm also on methotrexate and prednisone. I have recently quit Plaquenil and Celebrex."
208,"Humira (adalimumab) for Crohn's Disease, Maintenance",9,I had forgotten how it felt like to be normal and healthy. To have energy. I was experiencing this after three months on Humira only to be abruptly dropped from my insurance plan. So thankful for the Abbvie patient assistance plan which has now approved me for a full year! I am looking forward to getting better again in the months ahead. I was afraid I was going to lose my job because of the flares but now I am hopeful. Thanks
209,Humira (adalimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,8,"I have been on all the medicines and have achieved remission of various lengths with gold injections (1.5 yrs), minocycline (8 yrs), Enbrel (5 years before the efficacy started to diminish) and Humira (1 year) over the past 30 years. As a result of all the medicine treatments I now have horrible lung complications similar to COPD (have never smoked anything). When the pain is excruciating you are willing to take anything to make it better. Enbrel and Humira have left me with a continuous sinus infection that I keep under control with regular salt water rinses. I have no ability to fight off infection and keep getting lung infections which require me to stop the injections for the arthritis and every time you stop, your body builds immunity."
210,Humira (adalimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,"I have been taking Humira for four years. Before starting I had severe RA pain in different joints most of the time and RA flare ups left me very debilitated. Humira began to work within the first two months. I take the injection every 10 days. I currently have no RA pain, experience no flare ups and have no side effects. It has been a wonder drug for me."
211,Humira (adalimumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,1,"Took humira for AS and it worked great the first month and my pain went down to a 1.  By month 6, I had contracted klebsiella pneumonia from my lowered immune system from this drug and a subsequent systemic candida infection.  That was 10 years ago and I still have severe systemic candida from this poison.  Nothing has helped...antifungals work but only temporarily because Humira permanently changed my immune system.  I am now on permanent disability because of having to cope with both my original illness as well as the devastating effects from this DNA altering drug. People...Abbotts labs does not care about you...only their bottom line and making billions. Humira is now black labeled meaning you take it at your own risk and Abbott labs will not be responsible if you get infections or cancer from it because you were warned by their label...."
212,Humira (adalimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,"I have had rheumatoid arthritis for three years. It came on overnight and totally overwhelmed me in pain. Thanks to a great doctor I was immediately referred to a Rheumatolgist who started me on methotrexate(weekly), prednisone(daily) and Humira every two weeks. My doses of Prednisone was gradually reduced and I have now been off totally for 6 months. I went from 20mg of Methotrexate weekly to zero now. Humira is the only medicine being taken weekly and even though stiffness and swelling have returned to some degree I am still great compared to where I started. Side effects include higher liver enzymes and daily itching outbreaks. Otherwise, if I can remain at this level for another 30 yrs. I'll be fortunate. "
213,Humira (adalimumab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,10,"I was put on Humira when I was 25 and I am now currently 31.  The first thing I noticed was that it cleared up my plaque psoriasis very quickly.  My nails and scalp looked normal within 3-4 weeks.  I have PsA in my spine, ankles, knees and hands.  I was having trouble walking and experienced chronic fatigue which caused me to gain 20 lbs very quickly.  I would fall asleep from exhaustion after getting myself showered and dressed.  After the Humira took effect I had my energy back.  I could exercise again and I was back to doing the things I enjoyed.  I still experience flare ups (mostly due to stress) and I still have difficulty sitting for long periods of time, but this drug was life changing.  Vicodin helps me with the flare ups."
214,Humira (adalimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,9,"I've been on Humira nearly a year now (I use the self-inject pens) for RA. Previously I'd been on Prednisone, which helped the pain but had horrible side effects, and methotrexate, which didn't help and had horrible side effects. Humira has been a life safer. The shot itself definitely stings, especially in the thigh, but I went from constant pain, a severe limp, and inability to do much of anything to basically a slightly less flexible but otherwise normal able-bodied person. No side effects have yet appeared. I don't know how I managed without it for so long. It's not cheap, but if you make under a certain yearly income and you call the company, they'll work with you to make if affordable."
215,Humira (adalimumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,10,"I noticed a few bad reviews so I wanted to share a good one. Started January 7, 2017. Still on Humira and in remission. My insurance agent made it 8 years and I just met a friends buddy who is in year 11 of remission on Humira. Give it a go! If you’re at the point of looking up reviews on meds, you need to try for yourself. Just because one person had a bad experience doesn’t mean you will. Good luck!"
216,Humira (adalimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,,"Hi! I have been living with RA for the past 8yrs. I have it in my left foot and both wrist moving to my knees. (lovely)@ 53? As everyone knows who is on the site the pain for most of us is constant. Wake up w/ it still there if you want to go walking mid afternoon. Dinner time tired don't feel like cooking. Tell your MD, They tell you about Humira.... All these great biogenics on the market, how good are they? Last Sat I ended up in the hospital over night. Feeling heart racing.  Sweating, body and mind feeling exhausted can't move or even lift my hand. Has anybody got any of these symptoms while taking Humira. 

I welcome any feedback.."
217,Humira (adalimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,,For ankylosing spondylitis and Rheumatoid arthritis. I am 28 years old and today was my first dose. They did two in one and after 15 minutes I felt an ease in pain and stiffness  but probably won't feel the full effect for a couple a days. So far so good. You have to work with medication. It's a 50/50 type of deal. 
218,Humira (adalimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,My 86 year old mother has been on Humira for the past 2 years. She combined this treatment with methotrexate.  Towards the end of the 2nd year the effect of each Humira dose lasts less than 14 days at a time.  Going down to 10 days at a time then it completely stopped working for her.  She has an excellent doctor and we are looking at other alternatives for the moment. Possibly Orencia.  Overall Humira worked wonders while it lasted.
219,"Humira (adalimumab) for Crohn's Disease, Maintenance",10,I’ve had Crohn’s disease for 3 years now and have been on Humira for 2 and a half years. I love this drug. I am currently 19 and it has let me go to college and live a regular life. The only problem I had with it was the stinging pain I felt when it was injected but they have recently changed that so now it’s painless.
220,Humira (adalimumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,3,"I resisted taking this drug for at least a couple of years, but finally gave it a try. Sulfasalazine didn't do all that much by itself. After about 3 months, the pain was significantly lessened. I could walk much easier, the back pain much lessened. After about a year, shingles. Oh, joy. About 3 months after that, huge, ulcerated sores started developing. No one could explain what they were. Copious drainage, would not heal. Completely stopped taking Humira at that point. Took 2 months to stop new sores  from cropping up. Every single one is still present, 4 months later, in various stages of healing. Do NOT take this drug if you have ANY other option. I shudder to think what it's doing or has done that I don't know about yet."
221,Humira (adalimumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,9,"Female, age 40 with Ankylosing Spondylitis on Humira 2 x monthly for 2.5 years.  I am so thankful for this medicine! I was crippled by this disease during inflammation for several years and Humira eliminated it.  The only drawbacks are that I am still chronically fatigued, am prone to infections, and fear the unknown long-term effects of Humira."
222,Humira (adalimumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,10,"I am 19 years old and was diagnosed with Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) when I was 17. I was prescribed Humira very quickly because my AS caused severe back, hip and ankle pain and have been taking it for over a year now. So far, the medicine has worked very well and I feel no pain whatsoever. The medicine does make me feel tired, but this is a genuine side effect."
223,Humira (adalimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,5,"I am 18 years old, I just found out I had rheumatoid arthritis and I have been on Humira for 3 months. I have flare ups every once in a while but I do have to take methedrol along with it. it's a strong medicine and it messed up my stomach and gives me heartburn also. 


I guess for me Humira will take the 6 months it will to take effect and till then this winter will be the worst for me. 

keeping a positive outlook on this knowing I'm not the only one."
224,"Humira (adalimumab) for Crohn's Disease, Maintenance",10,"I have had Crohn's disease for about a year and a half and Humira has been amazing. I felt relief within one month and was in remission within 9 months. Life is pain free..only side effect is yeast infections every week and feel like I have the flu the week right before due for shot. Shot is painful for 10 seconds, but it is worth it. Remicade is only other option, using it as last resort. Otherwise very satisfied."
225,Humira (adalimumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,10,"Hey everyone! I decided to write a review because I was extremely nervous about trying this medication due to all of the negative reviews on here. My U.C. got really out of control without me even realizing it throughout college, and eventually I decided to take charge of my health. My GI and I discussed all options and decided Humira was a good fit. I have now been on it for a year and fully in remission!! No blood and very little mucus for the last 7 months. I was discouraged because I saw no improvement for about 3 months but I began to feel so much better soon after. I have not been sick from the immunosuppression at all, I was also worried about that. Give this medication a good try and give it some time if it is a good fit for you!!! Good luck everyone!!"
226,"Humira (adalimumab) for Crohn's Disease, Maintenance",10,"This medicine has given me my life back. I was initially very afraid because of all the potential side effects and I tend to react severely to medicines. But my Crohn's Disease and rheumatoid arthritis progressed to the point where I couldn't function anymore. I started Humira in conjunction with Plaquenil and it has completely turned my life around. The pain and stiffness are gone, the fatigue is significantly reduced and I have lost weight and have the energy to exercise again. The injections are not pleasant, and the initial side effects of nausea and flu- like symptoms were pretty rough for the first couple of injections. I got worse after the first one, but I'm glad I stuck it out because I'm doing fantastic now."
227,Humira (adalimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,7,"For the most part the experience has been good, my rheumatoid arthritis is in remission and no pain or stiffness. Recently had my first setback a serious bladder/kidney infection that came on supper fast. A short hospital stay with IV antibiotics and then followed up with a 12 day course of Cipro it cleared up. If this occurs again I may rethink the whole biological course of action."
228,Humira (adalimumab) for Psoriasis,10,"Reading these reviews finds me nodding my head with approval. After years with plaque psoraisis, its over...at least for now.  I did creams, Enbrel for 2 years, now Humira for about 6 months.  Initially it worsened then got way better.  Now, I have been off the Humira for over 3 months and nothing has come back.  My skin is 99% better.  I had over 50% coverage on my body and it was unsightly, painful, and nasty.  Now it's all gone.  At this point in time I have to say: this stuff is remarkable."
229,Humira (adalimumab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,,"I  have had Psoriasis  for 32 long years on scalp, knees, elbows, back, sides, rear end area and have tried all the prescription creams and steroid injections, salt water and all the home remedies. Some helped but never got down below 20% coverage. The past 2 years I have had psoriatic arthritis in my toes, elbows, back, hips and neck. On 24 June 2016 I injected myself with Humira, within 2 days my pain throughout my body had gone down to a pain level of 1 to 2 from an 8 on a scale of 10.  I have not seen anything like it !!!!  I have taken my second dose and the pain level is around 1.  I was blaming my pain and stiffness on old age, I feel like I better than I have in 20 years. My psoriasis have lost all the scale and are smooth."
230,Humira (adalimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,,"Excellent drug for me..My illness was mis-diagnosed thus when it came to use the meds for controlling the disease either had mild to severe allergic reaction, or broke thru the meds within a year 1/2..I am in 3rd stage RA..Drugs like humira were out of reach for those of us in the moderate to severe stage due to cost..Humira is my last resort..It helps me tremendously.."
231,Humira (adalimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,1,"I am a 57 year old female, diagnosed with RA 29 years ago. I took Enbrel for 9 years, but began to have more frequent flares, so my rheumatologist switched me to Humira. I took the first injection 20 days ago and felt great until day 12, when I developed severe flu-like symptoms, with aches and pains and had a significant rash over my entire body and face. It was like having a major RA flare plus an itchy rash and headache at the same time.  I was prescribed a six-day dose of prednisone and 24 hour a day Benadryl. I had little  improvement three days latter and received a steroid shot  which was three days ago.  Four days later, I still have significant overall weakness, a major headache and injection site reaction from the initial and last injection."
232,Humira (adalimumab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,10,"I'm 22 years old and I was only 19 when I got diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis. At first, I didn't know what was happening to me. I suddenly couldn't do my daily exercise because my knees, feet, arms, fingers, back and neck started to hurt so bad that it was difficult for me to get out of bed, not to mention getting down the stairs. Every rheumatologist appointment was turning into a torture session with the cortisone injections and liquid being removed from my knees. Methotrexate did not do me good, so my doctor finally decided to start filling papers for my Humira injection. 1st injection was last week and WOW! is all I got to say. I've never been so happy in my life. My mornings are painless and now I work 10 hours a day without any Tylenol or prednisone."
233,Humira (adalimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,"I have been on Humira for 2 and a half years.  This stuff is a great medicine.  Yep it stings for a minute or two, but seriously, are you really going to complain about that with all the relief it brings?  Take the warning signs seriously and keep in touch with your doctor.  And be thankful there is something that brings us not only relief, but slow down the damage to our joints."
234,Humira (adalimumab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,10,"My son was diagnosed with Juvenile Psoriatic Arthritis when he was in fourth grade. By the time he was finally diagnosed he was in a wheelchair and unable to move most of his major joints...even his jaw was affected due to the severe arthritis. Today I can say thanks to God, Humira, and monthly visits to Shriner's Hospital he has graduated from High School and is now in REMISSION!"
235,Humira (adalimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,"I was on HUMIRA for three years after 14 years of methotrexate and a mix of other non biological meds. HUMIRA was brilliant however it has recently stopped working so well and my specialist is changing me to another anti TNF biologic. I'm really sad and sorry to leave my humira behind, it gave me a great three years, the best I've had since I first got RA. Will wait to see what the new MED is like, fingers crossed."
236,Humira (adalimumab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,10,"I have had psoriasis since I was 15 and mild psoriatic arthritis since I was 20, now four years later my psoriasis started to flare up after nearly a three and a half year remission due to treatment and develop in all the old places with it came severe psoriatic arthritis. Over the course of four months I went from moving normally to being in severe nearly constant pain and walking with a cane. I went to my dermatologist to see about any treatments and she prescribed me Humira. The day after the first two pen treatment I was walking with little pain and within a week I didn't need a cane any more. So far the only side effect I have had was a mild headache after the injection. Humira essentially gave me my life back."
237,"Humira (adalimumab) for Crohn's Disease, Maintenance",10,"I've had Crohn's disease since 05' and I struggled through high school with flares, pain, and just off balanced white blood cell count.  My doctor put me on Remicade when I was a junior. And a few days after I could barely walk, my legs were killing me, but to be it was worth it because I had somewhat of my life back. The summer I graduated we decided it would be easy to switch to Humira since I was going off to college.  It's my senior year and this summer will be my fourth year on Humira and I'm actually just having my first flare since starting Humira. They say they don't work forever but I at least got 3 and a half years out of it. Plus Humira helped pay for the cost of the medication"
238,Humira (adalimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,3,"I have taken my first injection four days ago and after half a day with just a runny nose and headache, I have become very unwell with such bad backache and pain under my shoulder blade, temperature and nightmares/depression I am feeling I may have to stop before the next one.
Has anyone out there felt like this after and weighed up the stiffness to severe new pains?"
239,Humira (adalimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,1,"I started Humira injectable twice a week in conjunction with Methrotexate and Mobic since March of this year with no side effects, but no felt benefits either. I had to stop due to surgery and restarted once weekly three weeks ago and been having severe joint pain since I restarted Humira requiring a short course of cortisone. Resume Mobic a week ago. Joint pain continues and just haven't felt myself since I started Humira. The pain wakes me up at night and I am just miserable. This is no quality of life. Thank you all for sharing your experiences, it is a comfort to know other people understand your symptoms and that you are not alone! I don't think this is the best medicine for me. :("
240,Humira (adalimumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,,"I am a 46 yr old male. Diagnosed 16 yrs ago with psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis. Treated with meloxicam and sulfasalazine but I have been prescribed so many different NSAIDs over the years. Have had iritis, and small patches of psoriasis on knees. Recently, disease has progressed to AS. Pain in hips, lower back and neck was terrible. Months of pain. My RA Dr suggested Humira. I researched and initially was nervous of side effects but honestly, the pain was so bad I needed to try something. I took my first injection two days ago and already my pain is nearly gone. What a difference in such a short time. No side effects yet but I am staying positive."
241,Humira (adalimumab) for Psoriasis,10,"I have suffered with psoriasis for 15 years of my life and at it's worst point it covered 85% of my body. I've always had good luck with medication like clobetasol and talconex but it always came back - seemingly, with a vengence at times.  It affected my self esteem, my confidence and absolutey affected me mentally. I went to my dermatologist after hearing about Humira and after going through all the testing and having it approved through my insurance, I gave myself my first two shots four days ago.  My skin is almost completely cleared and the difference is remarkable. I recommend this drug to anyone who suffers - give it a try, you may love it.  For the first time in 28 years, I feel like normal girl."
242,Humira (adalimumab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,10,"Fantastic response, no sides effects except for occasional bruise. I thought it would take a few weeks/ months to really notice a difference. Reality was big impact after only a few days. One of those cliche ‘feel I have been given my life back’ moments. I really have very little signs of any disease. I was very concerned about risks but strangely I have not even had a common cold in 2 years !"
243,Humira (adalimumab) for Crohn's Disease,10,I have been on Humira for 3 years. The injection is painful but the results are excellent. I do not even feel that I have a disease any longer. Lots of energy and feeling normal is so worth any of the possible side effects. Just be careful and stay away when possible from any ill persons or high populated areas.
244,Humira (adalimumab) for Psoriasis,9,"I have had psoriasis since I was 16 years old, covering over 90% of my body. I am a woman of 53 now, I have used creams, to no avail. I have been on Humira injections for about 18 months and I am clear and was actually able to wear a bathing suit to the beach this year with no signs anywhere of psoriasis.  It has truly changed my life and my outlook.  I am after all these years finally clear, normal.  I don't have to hide myself with long sleeves and long pants year round, answer those awkward questions and looks from strangers. Truly a wonderful medication. No side effects as of yet, not looking for any this far along in treatment. The shot does tend to be a bit painful, through the few moments of pain, I receive clear skin."
245,Humira (adalimumab) for Crohn's Disease,10,"I have been on many medications but have felt indifferent about them as I never really saw my symptoms improving or worsening. I just always felt horrible and accepted that this was my life with chronic illness! I feel so strongly about how wonderful Humira is that I had to write my first review. Humira changed my life in less than two months. I am an active student athlete and have never felt healthier than I do now! I recommend it to anyone and everyone who suffers. I know people respond differently to meds but as much as it has helped me, I think it is more than worth a try. I ended up on Humira because my insurance would not cover Remicaid or Cimzia. I am SO glad it worked out the way it did."
246,Humira (adalimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,5,"Diagnosed with RA at 22yrs. Started with Plaquenil, it helped for a year then we added methotrexate. Took some time to get the dose right due to nausea. That combo helped for about 2 years. Then added Enbrel. Added Meloxicam. Prednisone as needed for the worst flareups. After serious ulcers I stopped the meloxicam and prednisone as they both increase changes of getting ulcers. Enbrel only worked for 1.5yrs. Just switched to Humira, still taking plaquenil and methotrexate. I prefer the syringes to the pens. Some relief in the first week, hoping it works for more than a year or two. Many illnesses due to the compromised immune system, and extreme fatigue, but my RA is so severe I am fully disabled without these meds.  I hope I can find one that will last a little longer. With the Humira support card, I have not had to pay for this drug."
247,Humira (adalimumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,9,"I’ve been on Humira for about 2 full years. The first 3-4 injections (taken biweekly, so 6-8 weeks) I wanted to stop taking it because the side effects were terrible. I’d have hot flashes, I’d be sweating but freezing, my hairs would stand up after taking injection, I’d throw up, wake up super sweaty. But after that 2 month period, WOW IS THE DIFFERENCE AMAZING. I have AS, I also have 2 replaced hips, and a left knee that also needs replacing. I’ve been dealing with this for about 8 years and ever since humira has came into my life it’s been so much better. It’s not where I wanna be but it’s better than where I was at/headed."
248,Humira (adalimumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,6,"My daughter is taking Humira after all other treatments for UC have failed her.  Her GI doctor just told her once you start Humira (she has been on it now for several months) you cannot stop using it.  Stopping could result in a massive flare up and loss of her colon.
So she has to take this stuff, which can have unbelievable side effects, her whole life?  Has anyone else's doctor told them this?"
249,Humira (adalimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,3,"18 yrs old; diagnosed with JRA in Jan. 2018. Take 6 pills of Methotrexate every week, one Humira shot every 2 weeks. Not the healthiest eater, notice when I do eat healthy major differences in effects. Take medications every Saturday night to sleep off pain. When I didn't care about diet I felt extreme effects of a headache and pain in the stomach. Noticed that if I eat a lot of food that day my effects aren't bad. Watch your diet !! With Humira the first few months I noticed pain went away. Was so happy, now I think that it isn't helping anymore. Feet still ache because of cold weather but the first few months I had no pain. I read reviews and the mention of tinnitus comes a lot. I thought ears may ring/hum because wearing earbuds but starting to believe that it may be caused by Humira. My doc told me I may need to take another med or Humira every week. After one year I shouldn't be given more medication but instead see improvements."
250,Cimzia (certolizumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,"Diagnosed with sero-negative RA after five years of joint replacements and worsening pain and disability. Got with a terrific Rheumatologist. On Hcg, methotrexate and then Cimzia. Been on it for just over a year. Life is almost normal! No pain. No flares. Some belly fat weight gain ( yuck), some hair thinning but that’s about it for side effects. Monthly blood work is perfect. Very thankful everyday for giving me my life back! Pray that this continues."
251,Cimzia (certolizumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,"I have been taking Cimza for about 10 years. I tried Enbrel and it worked about 2 months, then went on Humira and it worked for about 6 months. After that I was put on Cimza and have had the very best results for the last 10 years. I pretty much do everything I was doing before RA and it was very bad at one time, my pain was unbearable at onetime.  I have had some weight gain (10-15 lbs) but that is fine with me, my lab work comes back great every time."
252,Cimzia (certolizumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,8,"Just beginning cimzia (certolizumab) and now at one month shots, I actually woke up and my hands moved without pain and stiffness so it works !! The  side effects are becoming less. The early side effects were fever and pain, even though it is now helping my joint pain. I have high hopes and will continue with this medicine.  I am hoping for less pain and future joint damage"
253,Cimzia (certolizumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,9,Dmards were not working and Rheumatologist said MTX was too damaging to liver. I was leary of trying biologics because I gain weight with every new drug I try. Cimzia has given me my life back but I have gained 15-20 lbs. I had a gastric sleeve done 3 yrs ago and maintained same weight for 2 yrs. The weight came on from this drug. Cimzia does cause weight gain. Maybe you will or will not gain weight. These bioligics affect your body chemistry and metabolism. I am depressed about it. But I am working on getting the weight off. I heard others say do not bother it will not come off till you stop the medicine. I would rather be pain free and have a stomach roll than crippled and depressed from pain. I have no other side effects from it. The first few starting doses I had a lot of fatigue for a few days. That went away. Good luck. Remember not everyone gains weight. I just know it did it with me in particular.
254,Cimzia (certolizumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,6,"This medicine was initially a God send and my joint problems got better to the point that I was able to cut down on my pain killers.  Side effects included upset stomach and abdominal pain, muscle pain.  Unfortunately I have developed thyroid nodules and my liver has become enlarged and my spleen shrunk - all was well when I had a scan before taking the medicine. Have had to stop the injections and my joint condition has come back with a vengeance. "
255,Cimzia (certolizumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,"Cimzia has been successful for me.  RA flares reduced to once every 3 or 4 months, and these have occurred with cause (using my hands for heavy work or undergoing a stressful event).  Only possible (not sure to blame Cimzia) side effect has been a recurring minor skin rash that I control with OTC creams.  I receive a monthly injection at my rheumatologist, and would hate to give up this medication!"
256,Cimzia (certolizumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,Cimzia was wonderful I had severe rheumatoid arthritis and the flare ups were terrible no side effects and if there were any they were so minimal I didn't notice.  It took effect relatively quickly after loading dose and second dose I was able to do things I hadn't be able to do for a while. My only warning is speak with your drug coverage as mine is apex and I had and awful time. They denied so many claims and my dr ended up having to take me off it and then I was worse than when I started with pain and all the flare ups and had to go thru the reauthorization for an alternative drug they would cover. It was terrible I wish I could have the Cimzia my dr originally prescribed
257,Cimzia (certolizumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,7,"This drug was a god send, my flares finally were at bay, I was even able to go back to lifting with my fiance 3 times a week! Huge downside is that I had a quick burst of Scalp Psoriasis and since then it has spread all over.. will have to unfortunately say goodbye and find another drug as its getting horribly out of control."
258,Cimzia (certolizumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,"Cimzia put my RA into remission.  Before I started this drug, I thought I would be coping with joint pain for the rest of my life.  Now, I function normally for the most part.    I haven't really experienced any side effects with this medication, except for a bit of weight gain."
259,Cimzia (certolizumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,4,"Hi there! I have been taking Cimzia for almost 4 months now and it has been working great for my RA. I can actually function and get out of bed pain free every morning. BUT after starting it, I now have very scaly, dry skin on my face. It is along my jawline, beside my ears, eyelids, sometimes my forehead, and my upper arms. But the biggest issue is that since starting it, I have not ovulated now for 3 cycles whereas before this, my cycles were like clockwork. One of the main reasons I started this medication was so that I could get off of Methotrexate and start trying to conceive. My doctor put me on it and then has been off because of an injury since and I haven't even had the opportunity to talk to her about what's going on. The nurse that I have with the Cimzia support group doesn't know much. Really starting to freak out because I am a bit older and am hoping the ovulation starts again but I am HIGHLY considering stopping the medication altogether."
260,Cimzia (certolizumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,9,"I was so hesitant to use Cimzia as I was so scared I would get sick and all the associated risk and side effects of an immune suppressant... well, in 3 weeks It was for the first time in 2 years being  pain free. I did feel exhausted and gain weight, whether it was because I lost my will to exercise or the medication directly.  I was pain free and I never got sick. Almost 2 years in and I have not even had a cold, one ache or pain etc. I have now changed my diet and forced myself to focus a bit more on my weight, vitamins to increase my energy and feel the best I have felt in 3 years!!! I am still on Cimzia however I am trying to lower my dose. "
261,Cimzia (certolizumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,9,"Took 12 weeks  for Cimzia to become effective. Have been on it a year now and experiencing very little stiffness or pain. Only issue is the size of injection, pressure needed to engage it for administration and pain of administration. But only lasts about 15 seconds.
I do get fatigue and viral type symptoms but no temperature about 24 hours after taking it."
262,Cimzia (certolizumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,,"I was to start today I have done other home injections Humira Embral to name a couple for Psoriatic Arthritis the Cimzia needles are huge they do not glide gently into the skin the needle burns and the medication as going in feels like fire under the skin the medication seems to leak, I immediately had a taste in my throat, I couldn’t even finish the first Injection and as I said I am not new to home Injections.
Will be calling my Doctor in the morning to let her know this is not a medication I can use.
I would not recommend their choice of syringes for home self injection, along with whatever they use that burns so strongly"
263,Cimzia (certolizumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,8,"Cimzia worked the best and fastest for my RA. I was on Simponi & Enbrel before but they stopped working after a few months and took some time to kick in. The only thing is that all these biologics make my psoriasis come back for some reason. Also, I've been having hive-like reactions on my mouth and cheeks almost daily for the past 2 months."
264,Cimzia (certolizumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,"I use to take Humira and it helped for 2 years, my doc put me on Cimzia around when it first came out. I been on it since 2010 and only 1 problem, my blood pressure goes up. Happens to only 1 out of 100 people, when it starts to wear down my blood pressure returns to normal. I started about 3 yrs ago to only take half dose (one syringe) and that shot will last for 31 days. This is great for me cost wise doing it this way. As far as the psoriasis goes take virgin olive oil 2 TBS every day and good fish oil."
265,Cimzia (certolizumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,6,"The product Cimzia works OK for my RA, but the company is one of the worst in regards to patient support, I would try others like Humira first prior to starting this.  It should be a last option just  due to the lack of patient support.  I would list all of the areas they are lacking in, but it would take too long.  Other Biologics have their act together with better HUBs and support."
266,Cimzia (certolizumab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,10,"I have taken Cimzia for 3 years now with once a month injections.  It is a miracle drug.  No side effects no arthritis pain no psoriasis and I am physically active everyday.  I play tennis, baseball and golf.

This is a miracle drug."
267,Cimzia (certolizumab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,7,I've finished my loading dosages and will be starting monthly maintenance in two weeks.  So far it's been great for the pain but has done nothing for the psoriasis. Methotrexate worked for both but I couldn't handle the constant upper respiratory infections. Then tried Otezla which as far as I'm concerned should be banned. Horrible side effects but did work for the psoriasis thought did not do much for the pain. Then they put me on sulfasalazine which I'm allergic to. So now it's Cimzia. I'm far more active than I have been in the last year. I can't complain because it has helped with the pain and I have not had any adverse side effects yet.
268,Cimzia (certolizumab) for Crohn's Disease,5,"Just to update, after 2 years of success, this medication caused me  Drug-induced lupus (DIL) just like the others. I have partial use of my one hand and whole-body joint pain. I don't think there is much left for me to do anymore with drugs."
269,Cimzia (certolizumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,1,"Not only did the booster shots make me nauseous, lethargic, have NO appetite, and give me daily diarrhea, they did absolutely nothing for the stiffness of pain...nothing at all.  On top of that they messed up the billing and tried to bill me $16,000 for the booster shots alone - luckily I was able to get the hospital to write it off otherwise I would owe them a new car almost!  BS!  Enbrel was great for many years then stopped working...everything since has been a severe blow to my system overall - especially Remicade which nearly stopped my heart AND gave me pancreatitis....super fun!  There is no way  I will ever ever ever touch another TNF related medication or biologic as such.  Thanks but no thanks...I would rather deal with the severe debilitating pain than severe debilitating pain AND feeling like total rubbish constantly from this poison medication!  Beware."
270,"Cimzia (certolizumab) for Crohn's Disease, Maintenance",10,"I was diagnosed with Crohns Disease a while ago and was hurting non stop. I lost over 15 pounds in 2 weeks. After about 4 months of being on Cimzia I don't even worry about my stomach. Maintain a good diet, take your vitamins, and drink plenty of water. Cimzia seems like a miracle drug."
271,Cimzia (certolizumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,7,I’ve been on Cimzia for about a year with good but not great success.  The injections are very painful.  My recent problem is I am getting a very itchy red rash on my eyelids.  It starts on one eye then moves to the other.  It then goes away and the skin flakes off.  After a week it starts the cycle over again.  Waiting to get into the dermatologist before fully blaming the Cimzia.
272,Cimzia (certolizumab) for Spondyloarthritis,8,"Side effects from Cimzia last about a day or two after injection (slight fatigue, mild headache & mild diarrhea). Nothing compared to my life before Cimzia. Cimzia has lowered GI distress by over 80% & joint pain by about 50%. I have had dark bruising or redness, swelling and rash at the injection site, but it never lasts more than a week. It also doesn't happen every time. I do place a timer on my phone to remind me when I'm due, as well as the last injection site, because it's easy to forget. You do want to move around each injection. I also make sure the Cimzia is not super cold before injecting & I go very slowly, as it seems to not to burn as bad when injecting as well. I did have a horrible reaction to Humira, within 12 hours I came down with an intense pneumonia. The docs think it was an adverse reaction, thankfully never had that with Cimzia."
273,Cimzia (certolizumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,10,"I am 23 and I have had symptoms of AS for 5 years. When I took my first dose of Cimzia I was in a really bad flare. I woke up 2 days after taking it and was able to clean my house, plant things in my yard, and complete tasks I hadn't done by myself in over a year. I had some nausea that went away after 2 weeks. I have only had to take Aleve 4 times since I started Cimzia 6 weeks ago. I had one night with what I would call moderate pain in the first week. This drug has brought about a major reduction in pain and stiffness for me. I want to recognize my AS is not very advanced but this drug really made me feel almost normal after just a month. I will try to update my review when I've been on it for longer. So far I am very impressed."
274,Cimzia (certolizumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,8,"I've had horrible pain since August 2014, with very few remission periods. Humira worked okay for 2 months then stopped. My Dr said my immune system built up antibodies to block it. Then Enbrel was tried, didn't help with the pain and I had a mild allergic reaction to the third shot, so finally my Dr tried Cimzia! 5 days after my first injections I awoke pain free!!!! 
It lasted almost 3 weeks then I had a flare. But this flare isn't as severe as some I've had. 
No side effects and Cimzia so far is working great!!! 
Now if my immune system won't build antibodies against it!!!"
275,Cimzia (certolizumab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,9,"Almost instant relief of joint pain and inflammation on first injection, no reaction to needle. Great help from Cimzia Support. Still taking methotrexate weekly
injection twice a month, still have inflammation."
276,Cimzia (certolizumab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,10,"I began using Cimzia, my 3rd biologic, in March of 2016. I'd been in a wheelchair for about 1 1/2 years and was very sad. Every inch of my body was affected and in severe pain,  especially my spine and pelvic area. I'd been on two other biologics each for several years but continued to get worse, especially during the second biologic. Once I started on Cimzia, by the 3rd day I could feel changes in my entire body, like it was waking up, getting stronger if that makes sense. After one week (7 days) I walked! I began to lose weight and got my life back - something I never dreamed I'd have again. I'm certain the Cimzia gave me a boost in getting my weight off. I even got a knee replacement and starting taking water aerobics. In total lost 83 pounds. I'm still on Cimzia and doing great! I take two injections each month per medicare guidelines now, but back before I turned 65 I took one injection every two weeks. I've had no side effects whatsoever. These shots don't burn."
277,Cimzia (certolizumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,3,"Have ankylosing Spondylitis (AS), Crohn's & psoriatic arthritis (PA) and  was on Remicade for 9 years, it worked and I felt well with seldom flares.  Then it stopped working and so I went onto Cimzia.  My AS is the pits,  My whole upper body hurts.  Crohn's is so so.  Looking for a newer medication that treats all three.  Anyone else have all three autoimmune diseases?"
278,Cimzia (certolizumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,10,Love this medicine!!! I also have RA and take the mx shot rasuvo. The 2 shots from the starter pack lasted 3 weeks. I can walk barefoot and play sports with my kids. orencia wore off after about 3 months and humeria was like taking water. No side effects thus far. One happy mom!!!
279,Cimzia (certolizumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,2,"I cannot say my experience with these medications- enbrel, humira, simponi & cimzia have been positive. For some odd reason my body is continually rejecting them. I end up with the uncommon/ rare side effects and have to stop using. Seems once I reach a 3 month mark is when the side effects start showing. My last trial has been with cimzia, which I began symptoms for the past month or more and my research doctor had told me my symptoms were not from the cimzia.This last injection I took 3 days ago, now has given me terrible swelling in my feet and lower legs. I am at a loss now.Seems there is nothing else on the Canadian market for A.S."
280,Cimzia (certolizumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,4,"Used cimzia injection once a month for 3 years in the thigh area. Didn't completely do the job, so switched to another med. About 6 months off Cimzia I developed an AVN and had to have right hip replaced, now 2-1/2 months later the left hip is doing same thing, getting that hip replaced too.
Some medical professionals tell me it's the Cimzia that caused the Avascular necrosis (AVN). 
So folks, please be careful when choosing Cimzia. It caused me more problems than it was worth."
281,Cimzia (certolizumab) for Crohn's Disease,7,"I have Crohns with AS and right sided ulcerative colitis. Failed Remicade, failed Enrico, Humira gave me medically induced lupus and been on Cimzia for 2 years. I have never been in a total remission but Cimzia worked decently for 1.5 years. Now I’m afraid it’s beginning to fail. The only hope I have is this is just a flair that might end soon. It’s been 4 weeks."
282,Cimzia (certolizumab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,3,"Cimzia worked well to treat my Psoriatic Arthritis but never really cleared my psoriasis. After a bout of Strep, my entire body became inflamed and I had to switch to Taltz (entirely different family than Cimzia).
Total of 2.5 years on Cimzia. Then last year they changed their Savings card from a RX Bin to a preloaded Visa. I had to call every month to load the savings card then I had to call the specialty pharmacy every month to refill my prescription. Total of about 45 minutes to an hour a month to get it all processed. Was much more difficult than Humira and Enbrel process. Was very annoying. When I voiced my frustration with the Cimzia Savings card team, they were snippy and said ""well, you're getting $750 in free medicine"". Which was incorrect, I'm lucky to have good insurance so it would have only been $25 copay. Looking back, it would have been beneficial to dump the savings plan and pay the $25 to avoid frustrations."
283,Cimzia (certolizumab) for Crohn's Disease,9,When all else failed (I had done Asacol and Remicade along with 6-mp and other treatments; Remicade did well at first but over time stopped working) I have found this medicine to be a great replacement for Remicade. The nurse comes to the house so its more convenient. The only down side is that it's injected intramuscularly and not I.V.
284,Cimzia (certolizumab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,1,"I had 2 injections and now I have Pharyngeal adema, very hoarse gravely voice, horrible dry cough, fluid in one lung, swelling feet, uncontrolled diarhea at times.  I was given 2 injections when this all started.  I have been on Enbrel, Humira, Simponi, Remicade (also caused cough but went away when I quit the infusions), Methotrexate.  I am back on Methotrexate with higher dose than before and doing fine but my Dr is very worried about the left over symptoms from the Cimzia.  HE put me on a Zpac 3 days ago and hopes this will take care of the infection and clear my lung."
285,Cimzia (certolizumab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,1,"Been on Cimzia for almost 3 treatments, i.e. 3 months. It caused me a terrible migraine and never resolved the psoriasis on my hands. It caused pain and inflammation in my left arch and heel of my foot that radiated pain up the leg and into the hip that I just received a cortisone injection in. The pain is quite severe and lasts for at least 5 days after my treatments. I still experience arthritis stiffness and pain in my fingers and toes. I will now be trying Otezla which sounds quite scary to take but I will give it a try."
286,Cimzia (certolizumab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,1,"Horrible experience after 3rd loading dose injection of Cimzia. Feel sick in lower abdomen and bladder is bloated. Severe IBS pain, bloating, mucous-diarrhea, constipation and more pain. Very upsetting, and Rheumatologist just said go to ER for help during a pandemic. No help on symptoms or coaching. I do not believe that 94% of patients stay on this med. What a pity.
I really needed it. Haven’t eaten in 2 days.
Never took the 1st monthly injection after the 3rd loading dose. It’s a dangerous med."
287,Cimzia (certolizumab) for Crohn's Disease,5,"I initially took Cimzia as part of a clinical trial.  During the trial, we received a full dose (400 mg) every 2 weeks but, once it was available on the market, the dose was only 400 mg every 4 weeks (or 200 mg every 2 weeks).  The medicine wore off before the 4 weeks was up, so I switched to Humira, which worked much better.  Now that I've had rare side effects to Humira (and already failed Remicade), I've had to switch back to Cimzia.  It is only working for about a week and a half of the four weeks (at 400 mg).  I hope to find another alternative, as this isn't worth it."
288,Cimzia (certolizumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,8,"Was using Cimzia every month for 3 years. Seemed to work except for one knee didn't calm down. Went off Cimzia in Feb and by July I had an avascular necrosis of my right hip, had replacement surgery in Sept and now into Feb of following year and need the left hip replaced. Drs say the Cimzia is most likely the cause of my hip issues.
Cimzia works for one issue but then causes another issue.
BE CAREFUL WITH THIS MEDICINE FOLKS!"
289,"Cimzia (certolizumab) for Crohn's Disease, Maintenance",10,"I was able to use CimPay to cover my $350/month copay. I was in such total remission that it felt like I didn't even have Crohns. Loved not going to hospital for Remicade infusions and had no problems with injections or any side effects. Unfortunately, now have been exposed to TB and am positive for Latent TB Infection and must discontinue Cimzia. Abdominal pain restarted at just one week past missed dose, so have been prescribed Pentasa."
290,Cimzia (certolizumab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,8,"Diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis almost 2 yrs ago.
1sr Dr put me on methotrexate...
and Prednisone.
Didn't do anything for the pain and stiffness.
Moved and got with a new Dr.
Was screened and started on Cimzia.
Worked GREAT!.
Dr closed his practice and I have to go to a different Dr.
Took 6 months to get in with my current Dr.
Had to get a new schedule of treatment and restarted the Cimzia.
Loading does aren't as effective as before,hoping the meds will take hold soon.
Cannot use my right thumb due to an inability to flex the thumb joints. Sucks when it's your dominant hand.
Hoping the Cimzia will be able to reduce the issues with my hands soon."
291,Cimzia (certolizumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,2,"Tried on Humira but had a hiccup cough shortly after the injection and ended up with itchy rashes within a few days of each injection. Stopped Humira after two injections. Tried Cimiza today, immediately had a migraine headache and hot flash within increased blood pressure.  Ten minutes later I had horrible post nasal drip with lung spasm like coughs with sight hoarseness.  Noticed thirty minutes later blister like hive patches on left arm along an aggravated nerve path.  Guess am allergic to it too.  Good luck to everyone else trying this medication in hopes of ending their pain and on-going joint damage.  It doesn't work for me and am not willing to take the risks of continuing this medication."
292,Cimzia (certolizumab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,2,"My psoriasis flared and became the worse I have had in the 30 years I have had it. Also, I have had a significant increase in my lower back and hip pain. I have been having injections in my hips every two weeks."
293,Cimzia (certolizumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,3,"I’ve tried Humira, symphoni aria, Remicade, and Concentrix. Remicade worked the best but it only lasted for about three weeks and I could only get the infusion every six weeks.  Now my doctor has switched me to Cimzia. 
I’ve only had three doses but so far the result has been far less than I had hoped. My back pain has increased threefold and I’ve gained at least 6 pounds. I feel tired all the time. Some folks report it took up 12 weeks to feel better so I feel like I should give it some more time but at this point I wish I were back on the Remicade. At least I was getting relief for three weeks out of every six."
294,Cimzia (certolizumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,1,"I have been suggested CIMZIA when I informed my doctor that I plan on having a second kid. I am not really sure if CIMZIA is good or bad. I just had 1st dose of cimzia and have experienced stomach pain, irregular period and constant headaches. I am trying to reach out to the doctor, to know if I should even be continuing this drug and plus to mention other scary side effects they show on google."
295,Cimzia (certolizumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,8,"I read some reviews on the drug & wondered if it’s helpful how come some people remain on it 10 years. If there’s no inflammation, why stay on it if it suppresses the immune system this is what scares me with this drug. I am also taking methotrexate so I’m not sure which one is working. I was coughing up blood for over a week & called the doctor office who said cimzia has no side effects so I should call my primary care doctor to get evaluated. Has anyone experienced bleeding while on the medication, weight gain I know is one, and perhaps blurred vision not sure. I have found relief but like I said not sure which drug is responsible."
296,Cimzia (certolizumab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,4,"Finished 3 loading doses over past month, now on monthly maintenance.  Psoriasis on hands/elbows/feet still bad and my pain from psoriatic arthritis still fairly bad, but I am more mobile tho it hurts to move. Tried methotrexate, Humira and Otezla in the past.  Sick with a cold, we'll see how this treatment goes.  Hoping for better results with more time."
297,Cimzia (certolizumab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,3,"The first day I had an injection it was like a miracle cure! My psoriatic arthritis was almost non-existent.  Unfortunately, the effects wore off after a few weeks and by the third month, it wasn't doing much of anything at all. Very disappointing - I'm back to the drawing board in finding something that will help."
298,Cimzia (certolizumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,Been taking this medication for RA for almost 2 years. It's been amazing I finally have my life back. Was able to breastfeed and be pregnant whilst taking it and have healthy children. The injection pen is easy to administer especially into the stomach. I have no side effects. I found administering into my thigh much more uncomfortable and painful whilst pregnant. Over all 10/10 for me.
299,Cimzia (certolizumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,"I have been using this medication  Cimzia since 2012 and it's turned my life around. Not only is my illness in remission I am pain free and have an active, healthy and happy life."
300,Cimzia (certolizumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,9,"Found this medicine very helpful. I have had a lot of trouble finding the right biologic, and have tried half a dozen. Great medicine!"
301,Cimzia (certolizumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,9,GREAT. Feel better than ever using this medicine and only side effect was some weight gain.
302,Cimzia (certolizumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,10,I have been taking cimzia for my AS. I started 3 months ago and I haven't had a flare up.
303,Cimzia (certolizumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,,Fast and great relief from RA. My scalp psoriasis came back and have been diagnosed with hypo thyroid and had weight gain.
304,Cimzia (certolizumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,10,"I’m on week 9 it worked for me almost immediately, have had no pain and no symptoms so far."
305,"Cimzia (certolizumab) for Crohn's Disease, Maintenance",10,Cimzia manufacturer covers copays. Have to renew each year. Can't work as nurse without it. Inject every 3 wks.
306,Cimzia (certolizumab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,3,I have tried everything for psoriatic arthritis I felt for a short time that Cimzia then my psoriasis got worse then ever. I stopped it and started. Nothing has ever worked.
307,Cimzia (certolizumab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,9,"After exhausting other options, medications i am now on Cimzia, It works as well as most, better than some. Ease of use could be better, Support is great."
308,"Cimzia (certolizumab) for Crohn's Disease, Maintenance",10,This medicine has given me my life back. I no longer worry about knowing where every rest room is wherever I go. My only side effect is a headache the day after the injections.
309,"Cimzia (certolizumab) for Crohn's Disease, Maintenance",9,Love this med. take every 2 weeks works great. Did Remicade before and it's so nice not to have to go to the hospital.  Very nice to do injections at home  totally recommend
310,"Cimzia (certolizumab) for Crohn's Disease, Acute",5,"Cimzia didn't take care of the diarrhea associated with Crohn's Disease, but it did allow me to live flare free for over three years."
311,"Cimzia (certolizumab) for Crohn's Disease, Maintenance",6,I found it worked well but the side effects; SHARP pains throughout my body were not worth it.
312,Cimzia (certolizumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,,"I just started Cimzia got my loading dose and now I have been experiencing this itching all over my back for more than a week now, I never experienced this before."
313,Cimzia (certolizumab) for Non-Radiographic Axial Spondyloarthritis,1,Please see my review for Cosentyx. It describes my experience with Cimzia.
314,Simponi (golimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,1,"My wife was administered simponi infusions
Prior to the infusions she was a healthy active lady. She suffered from RA which was addressed with methatraxe and predozon..
The she was switched to Simponi.
She started exhibited all the side effects of this drug. She detetiorated very fast.
Today she's laying in an ICU fighting for her life. Doctors claim the major contributor to her ailing health was the Simponi. It's effects etc are irreversible. So. If you intend to go on this drug. Please research it and be very carefully monitored. It creeps on you and could kill you. It has turned my wife from a healthy active working woman to a physically and mentally incapacitated. Even if she pulls through this ICU nightmare. We have years of recovery. If any.
It is a shame these kind of drugs are allowed.
Even if it effects/kills/handicaps on person it should be  removed from the shelf"
315,Simponi (golimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,2,"After my wife was taking Simponi for about a year under the direction of  her arthritis doctor, she came down with a rare neurological condition called CIDP (chronic inflamatory dimylating polyneurothapy) where she became almost totally paralized .   I think that the drug Simponi is very dangerous to take and she still can't walk after 2 years after stopping the drug.  She has to take infusions of IVIG  gamma globulin every third week to rebuild her nerves after the erosion of the myelin of the nerves took place.  This is a very serious side effect that no one has addressed.  I am sure that others have had this side effect hit them from taking Simponi.  We have spent over $200,000 in medical expenses toward my wife's recovery and will take at lease 1 to 2 more years for her to recover."
316,Simponi (golimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,"I am a male age 28 with RA.  I was diagnosed with RA at age 23.  I suffer pain primarily in my toes.  For a newly married athlete at age 23, the pain from RA and the thought of living the rest of my life crippled with pain - took a huge toll on me.  I felt ashamed as a man and as a husband/potential father. Fortunately, I have had great Docs work hard to help me get well.  I have been on plaquenil, sulfazalazine, methotrexate, enbrel, cimzia, and simponi.  Each med had some positive results but some had harsh negative side effects too. Like many of us- I want to be on as little medicine as possible - but still manage my pain.  Simponi has solved my riddle. I am so pleased to be pain free and on only 1 med now - Simponi. Thank you!"
317,Simponi (golimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,"I started Simponi  Approx 1 year ago.  I was first on methotrexate for about a year but developed a really bad cough and scarring on lungs.  I then was put on Remicade which took away every pain I had but on third infusion, I had an allergic reaction so I had to be taken off.  Now I am on Simponi and by the third infusion, I have had no pain at all and no side effects.  I am on Medicare which pays for 80% and my UHC which pays the 20%...so I feel really lucky."
318,Simponi (golimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,9,"Was on Humira for 11 years, which stopped working. Enbrel, horrible reaction. Started Simponi in 
April. It took about 2 months to kick in, but now working great!  Sleeping  better than ever, have only had 2 days of minor pain. Only thing that is still challenging is the fatigue. Very happy with results and love the once a month injection."
319,Simponi Aria (golimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,"I just had my 2nd infusion and I feel so much better. I can do my everyday chores around the house without pain and fatigue. I feel like I am getting more oxygen, I know that sounds crazy but it is true. I can breath better.No stiffness in the mornings. I walk like a normal person again. My hair is falling out more that normal, I don't know if its the simponi , methatrate, or plaquenil. Going to call my doctor about my hair.I am on the drug company's assistance plan. I pay $ 5.00 for the simponi and $55.00 to the infusion center. ( thank god!) Simponi infusion costs $6500.00 with out insurance for 1 infusion. (August 2016, USA) I am 53, I feel better now than I have in 6 years. I have RA. Hope this helps someone decide to try simponi aire."
320,Simponi (golimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,"Simponi had been the first biologic that has worked for my very active JRA (diagnosed 48 years ago)
I tried every biological available, Simponi was the first medication to work within hours for my severe symptoms at the time, with no side effects. I have been using Simponi for 8 months. I pray it continues working."
321,Simponi (golimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,8,"I have been on Simponi since 11/09.  Took a couple of months to kick-in, and seems to wear off about the 3 1/2 weeks.  Best results I have ever had.  Did not use with Methotrexate due to had neuropathy symptoms when I take Methotrexate.  I have had rheumatoid arthritis for 18 years and I am 55 years old, been on every RA medicine, Simponi is the best for me."
322,Simponi (golimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,"I was also hit hard with rheumatoid arthritis in 2011. Tried prednisone, followed by methotrexate pills, Arava and others, nothing helped. In 2012 I was put on Humira which helped a lot for a few months, but not enough. Since January 2013 I use Simponi along with 0.8 ml methotrexate injections, and it has given me back my quality of life.
After 1 1/2 years I could bend my pinky finger again, wow! For me the change was subtle, but very effective. I tried alternative meds etc. after being diagnosed and didn't want to take this route, but honestly I cannot live without it. For me it works, it's a miracle."
323,Simponi (golimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,"My rheumatoid arthritis developed about three years ago and was very severe .. very debilitating. Walked at tortoise-pace, couldn't do anything around the house.
I've now been on Simponi golimumab prefilled syringes for almost that long, in conjunction with weekly injections of methotrexate and 4 tablets of Pyralin and one Plaquenil daily and really feel back to my old (now nearly 70) self. Can walk, chop wood, even play nine holes of golf again. "
324,Simponi (golimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,9,Was ready to retire from teaching from the pain and tiredness from difficulty walking from RA. Simponi gave me my life back. Reduced immune system from RA meds given as reason for Legionnaires disease but benefits far out way any negatives. At 7.00 am about to go on extended world trip.
325,Simponi (golimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,"I have had RA since 1987 and tried pretty much every drug and biologic out there. After a few weeks on Simponi  (2011) I swore that I was completely cured of my RA. Unfortunately the manufacturer does not give financial assistance to people on Medicare so I had to get off the best drug that ever worked and have been deteriorating ever since. Shame on Johnson & Johnson for not having compassion on patients who can't afford their drug. 
BIG DRUG COMPANIES!!!"
326,Simponi (golimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,9,"I have been on Simponi since five years ago. The medicine has been a miracle. I did notice the effect only after one or two weeks. After five years I have started to have increased pain and I think the effect of the medicine is loosing. However, Simponi has changed my life completely. From hard attacked by Bekterew, I have now been running and cycling (100 km) competition for many years."
327,Simponi (golimumab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,10,"I was almost wheelchair bound, every joint in my body inflamed and lots of pain walking.  Psoriasis was flaring too all over.

The day I took my first shot I could feel the joints loosening and pain lessening.  Within 6 months I was virtually pain free and completely mobile.  2 years now and I am riding my bike 25 miles a day and combined with light treatment my skin is 90% clear."
328,Simponi (golimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,8,"Started taking Simponi in November of 2013. I got full use of one hand back and about 80% on the other in 4 days. I was diagnosed in 2002 and disabled by 2003. I've used Humira, Enbrel, and Remicade all with some success but I continued to get worse. The infusion wears off around 5 to 6 weeks. This last infusion of Simponi was my best yet. My next infusion is tomorrow 6/23/14. Really need it too."
329,Simponi (golimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,6,"I started Simponi on November last year. I started noticing a rash on my face but I never relate it to the use of the med. Two weeks ago my dermatologist told me I have this weird reaction called mucinosis , which when not treated properly can lead to a lymphoma. I was feeling awesome with simponi so far cause the pain of my RA was gone but now I just don't want to use it anymore."
330,Simponi (golimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,,"I have been on Simponi for 4 months now. Just took my 4th dose. I love it. It just plain works. No swelling at all now. I work daily, on my feet, with my hands, bending, lifting etc. Pain free is the way to be. I switched from Humira to Simponi. Humira worked well, but had some minor side effects. 

The Humira ""pen"" just plain hurts. So I used the prefilled syringes of Humira.

The Simponi ""pen"" works great!! Painless, fast and easier to use. It allows you to hold it in your fist and squeeze to activate. It is a light squeeze, so no difficulty in using it. At least for me. 

It took a couple days to notice any effects, but all were positive. 

Doctor visits have been very good...."
331,Simponi (golimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,I'm a mid to severe RA patient. I have RA for about 4.5 years. I was quickly diagnosed. Less then 6 months I was prescribed  Simponi. In Canada my doctor got me lined up for Simponi and once I started they will give it to me free of charge. The drug company pays for it. I am very lucky. I have been in remission for since I started it 4 years ago.  Colin
332,Simponi (golimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,1,"I was on Methotrexate and Sulfasalazine for my RA for several years.  I have now received 2 infusions of Simponi with my third one the end of 11/16. The only improvement I saw was after the first infusion which helped with my stiffness.  I am still suffering with the pain and returning of stiffness. Also, my feet are really bad now. Does Simponi just not work for some people?"
333,Simponi (golimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,"I was hit hard with rheumatoid arthritis in March 2012 and practically disabled by May. I couldn't tolerate methotrexate or Enbrel due to reactions. I started Simponi in October with 20mg Arava. It has given me my life back!  I literally don't hurt at all most days!  After nine months, I did develop a bad case of Palmer Planter Psoriasis as a side effect. Yet, I still want Simponi!  That's how much it's improved my quality if life. The pens are easy to use and don't hurt compared to Enbrel.  I've had no other reactions besides a shaky feeling on first month only."
334,Simponi (golimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,"I have had Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) 49 years.  I have tried every biologic there is and Simponi has been the first drug to work for me within a few hours. I take simpono and self inject every 2 weeks, I also take low dose prednisone.
 I was diagnosed at age 6,  have many replaced joints and still some active joints with severe RA. 
I have been on Simponi for 18 months now, even though I have never had a remission, my symptoms have been the most controlled on this drug! :)
Pray it keeps working this well."
335,Simponi (golimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,8,I started taking Simponi 4 days ago after a very severe flare-up. I am 54 years old and have had rheumatoid arthritis for 29 years. I was pretty much incapacitated with the pain.  Two days ago I was able to resume my normal household chores and feel so much better!  I really hope the effectiveness continues.
336,Simponi (golimumab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,9,"I had been taking methotrexate for almost a year with moderate results. My skin cleared almost 80%, and my joints improved approximately 60%, however each time I took my medication I felt really ill for 48 hours afterwards. It was depressing. Anyway my Rheumatologist recommended Simponi. Having read the side effects, etc. I was a little apprehensive about taking Simponi, but after meeting with the Simponi nurse I decided to go with it. After two shots (2 months) I felt a big difference, my joints were no longer stiff and I was almost pain free. After the fourth shot my skin has cleared to 95% and I have no stiffness in my joints. It really is working for me."
337,Simponi (golimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,8,"Well, it has been about 12 days since I have taken my first shot of Simponi. I started on Saturday, August 29, 2009. I also stopped taking prednisone that day. I feel real good. I go to the Doctor on the 23rd of September. I would like to start cutting back on the methotrexate. I will update next month.  "
338,Simponi (golimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,8,"I am 65 with RA and have been on 8 different biologics.  Now on simphone doing well.  Methotrexate gave me interstitial fibrosis, another drug a dvt.  They all come with a price physically and financially but quality of life verses quantity....I choose quality. It's good to read others experiences it helps ..."
339,Simponi (golimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,9,"I have had two doses.  My doctor (and myself and my family) are very happy with the progress thus far.  I am a 38 year old mother of three and am so thankful for this medication.  My doctor hopes to start weaning me off methotrexate in the next few months.  I applied for the patient care plan and have had no problems with it.  I picked up my first dose last month at the pharmacy without any glitches.  Almost all swelling and pain is gone.  I noticed that it fades a bit the last week before my next dose.  We'll see how it goes this month.  Still, leaps and bounds better than taking three different kinds of medicines!  Thank you Simponi."
340,Simponi (golimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,"Have been on Simponi for 6 months. Works great, and within 1-2 days. Was on methotrexate for many months and it did nothing. Then tried Humira for 1 month which worked well. Rheumatologist then switched me to Simponi. Monthly injection is much better than every two weeks (Humira). Unfortunately my insurance, Health Spring, refuses to cover it. Dr. has been giving me free samples of Simponi. "
341,Simponi (golimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,9,"I started Simponi in April and have now had four injections.  It worked the first night, my shoulder pain was gone and I have slept without pain since.  I have had no reactions whatsoever.  The drug has lasted the full month every time.  In the month previous to my first injection I took 150 Tylenol 3's for the pain.  In the 3 months since  I have averaged 30 per month.  My shoulders, wrists, hands, and knees are almost pain free with very little stiffness.  I still can't work but at least I have my life back, thanks to Simponi.  Methotrexate was too hard on my kidneys but I still take 20mg Arava every other day and Plaquenil and Diclofenac daily.  I also take Ramipril for the raised blood pressure the drugs have caused."
342,Simponi (golimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,4,"I am 59...diagnosed with RA at 53. Started with Methotrexate for 6 months, added Enbrel...worked great for 4 years and then nothing worked for more than a couple months.  I just started first ever IV infusions in doctors office. Simponi Aria and also still on Methotrexate. First dose in Feb, 4 weeks later 2nd dose in March - nothing! Can’t walk on my feet and can’t use my hands. Worse shape I have been in.  Had the3rd dose is this first week of May 2020. Both my RA doctor and my regular doctor say don’t give up and that we need 4 doses to see if this medicine will work. I am hanging in there but life is passing me by right now. After 34 years as an Analyst at a Hospital who works on spreadsheets all day I am on a leave while we see if this Simponi Aria is going to help me. I am HOPEFUL!"
343,Simponi (golimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,8,"I have been taking Simponi Injections for over a year now. It works better than Humira. I also take Methotrexate which has my hair coming out. I was taking 4pills every week, now I'm taking 3 pills every week. I'm 39 years old and my hair is coming out even when I just have it braided. I love the Simponi. I know when it's time to take it again though."
344,Simponi (golimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,1,I had my first infusion today.  No ill effects with the exception of exhaustion...additional that is as I already am sleeping 16 hours per day. Not sure how a person is supposed to make a living with this advanced RA.  I am hoping that Simponi will resolve that in the near future Will let you know when things start to work and I can return to the land of the living.
345,Simponi (golimumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,10,"Had a major flare up back in April that almost lead to emergency Colonectomy. Hospitalized for 19 days straight, was in 2 different hospitals lost about half my bodies blood and 50 lbs over 6 months time. 1st doctor put me on many of the wrong medications as the disease was too severe. Starting out on Lialda, Uceris then up to Remicade which started to work for about a week and then Prednisone which was horrible. When I was in the 2nd hospital I had another Doctor prescribe Simponi and it took a while but is working for sure. I went from 20 times a day of red to 1 - 3 times a day (clear water)."
346,Simponi (golimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,4,"Simponi felt like it was working the first 2 months. But my flare ups are still monthly and today after 6 months, my doctor said I am getting worse, and is taking me off Simponi. I am 53, have rheumatoid arthritis since 2007."
347,Simponi (golimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,1,"Started  Simponi  in  February  and  so  far  nothing  has  changed,  still  pain,  swelling  and  disease  getting  worse.  I hope  you  never  have  a  problem  with  an  injection  because  the  people  at  Jensen  who  are  there  to  help  are  clueless."
348,Simponi (golimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,2,"I came off Rituxan after several successful years of treatment for RA (almost in remission) when I experienced 12-18 months of chronic infection in my lungs and ears. Diagnosed at age 53, 17 years ago. Have had both knees replaced and have carpal tunnel pain in one thumb.
 At same time as the infections  it was discovered I had a cat allergy. These two factors together meant my body could not get rid of the chest infections & ear infections because of the constant cat allergy creating stuffed up conditions
#5 Simponi Infusion in Sept to give it one last chance but since #1 Infusion was in April I have developed finger movement and pain. bunions. RA flares in second toe and a foot joint,  plus fatigue has sucked the interest in life right out of me. I felt great for 10 days this month on a Prednisone burst but am weaning off it next week. I do not have a lot of faith that Simponi will ‘kick in’ after 5 months and hope for something else soon that is more effective for me."
349,Simponi Aria (golimumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,8,"A recent dx of RA and AS has been debilitating, my Dr. said I should have been on meds 10 years ago due to the progression of these diseases. I started methotrexate 5 months ago with zero success. My first infusion with Simponi was 3 weeks ago and I feel so much better, I am praying that it continues to help!"
350,Simponi (golimumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,9,Recent colonoscopy confirmed no active inflammation.  Experiencing no side-effects.  Painless self-injector administered very 4 weeks.  The Only minor difficulties are dealing with the specialty pharmacy and properly disposing of the injectors.
351,Simponi Aria (golimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,I have been on this for about 5 years and have had RA for 40 years and tried lots of medications.  But this one  works for me the best. I also take Methotrexate with this and I have been free from illness over the past 3 years. I am only tired the week that I get the infusion and then I am fine after that. Glad to be able to move like I want to most of the time.
352,Simponi (golimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,3,"I am 3 weeks into my second dose of Simponi. Was on Enbrel for 4 1/2 yrs. with good results then it stopped working.  the numerous side effects following my first dose came close to keeping me from trying a second month. this month i have had diarrhea for 3 weeks but that's an improvement over last month.  joint pain, stiffness are better; but no effect on fatigue so far.  It takes 6-8 weeks to know for sure how it will work.  It is not possible to see results in hours or days. I have decided to try one more month since  my next step is infusion mediciness."
353,Simponi (golimumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,10,"I have been diagnosed with Ankylosing Spondylitis now for the last five years. I'm now 40 years old and it started to hit me quite hard after the age of 18 and started treatment on Humira at 35 first. Slack medical advice and thinking that I was fully cured, I stopped my treatment within 3 months my AS came back very strong as I was now working out 5 days a week in the gym. In Autstralia if you don't keep blood checks and things within certain times they strike you from the assistance hence my specialist has now put me on Simponi and all I can say is WOW. This stuff works and works well. I did notice very small signs of AS in the 4 weeks, which disappeared on the next injection. I found I had been given a new chance to live a normal life."
354,Simponi (golimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,9,"Yeaterday got my 4th injection in 4 months at home by a nurse!
I think it's working very well so far.....I have taken many other  types of medicines over 7 years with  big side effects for RA.
I have had Ulcerative Colitis  for 15 years and took some meds for that. Because of side effects I began a very stringent diet, (specific carbohydrate diet).
I eventually got better and all UC symptoms stopped. Years later went off the diet and was soon reduced to suffering immensely with undiagnosed  RA symptoms.
I believe  my diet  contributes to my symptoms. I know food chemicals  can cause inflammation  and I know UC is cousin to RA. 
I  come from generations of alcoholics and am recovering  for 27 years. Sugar is a deadly &  strong addiction.
Today I was lethargic "
355,Simponi (golimumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,10,"I have had severe and debilitating whole back/shoulder/neck pain since I was 17 - I'm now 27 and have always been very active. I was given Vimovo, which did not help all that much; and although Ibuprofen did help more (though not entirely), it was more dangerous for long-term use.

I had a false positive for the TB skin test - if this happens to you, ask for the TB Quanteferon test - it was $90 out of pocket, but came back with a 100% negative test result and I was able to take my first injection within that week - it's sad because I had the false positive in Oct 2013 and had to wait until mid-Feb 2014 to start on Simponi.

Simponi itself is wonderful.  Within hours, I felt no pain at all and had no side-effects.  I can put on socks again!"
356,Simponi (golimumab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,2,"I tried Simponi for 9 months for psoriatic arthritis. At first it was like a miracle. Then the pustular psoriasis started on my legs, my hair started falling out, and my mood got very strange. Bloodwork showed super high cholesterol which was 3xs what it ever was. Psoriasis flared worse than ever all over my body. My skin has never gone back to normal. Terrible, scary drug. Wish I'd never tried it."
357,Simponi (golimumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,8,"I have been suffering from ankylosing spondylitis for quite a number of years. In the past 3 years it has become very severe, and has made me feel very ill, thus inhibiting my quality of life. I haven't been able to hold down a long term job because of this arthritis. I took Humira initially which didn't work at all. I then tried Simponi, with quite good results. Morning stiffness and pain throughout the day had been significantly decreased. However it seemed to wear off after around 10 days or so. I bared the usual pain for a week or so, before I injected myself again 3 weeks later, instead of four. Hopefully my specialist will allow me to take it every 2 weeks instead of the usual 4 week injections."
358,Simponi Aria (golimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,5,"I have taken just about all the meds you can think of.  Some are better than others but after a while too many symptoms come up.  My latest Simponi seemed great in the beginning but as others stated I was tired all the time.  Contracted pneumonia, edema in the ankles and 3 UTI's in 6 months.  So I am going to go off. I think it suppressed my immune system so much I was sick all the time.  Not sure if I will try Humira - which others are taking and seem to be ok with it."
359,Simponi (golimumab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,7,I've been using Simponi for Psoriatic Arthritis for 5 months.  Before that I was using Enbrel.  I had a small amount of psoriasis on my scalp before starting Simponi and now I have much more.  I like the once a month injection but believe I'll be returning to Enbrel soon as I believe it did a better job.
360,Simponi Aria (golimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,9,"I began taking Simponi about 2 years ago. I've had RA for over 40 years.  It really helped my all of my symptoms of RA.  However I was diagnosed with Grovers disease within a few months,  This is an intolerable skin condition with severe and constant itching.  In May of this year I was diagnosed with Liposarcoma in my abdomen  This is a rare cancer of the soft tissue/ fat cells.  I am recovering from major surgery  in June to remove the tumor.  Doctors believe the tumor was contained and I am now cancer free.  Now my RA is out of control with Joint pain.  I will see my Rheumatologist this week to determine what to do.  Seems like all biologics have a risk of cancer but of course I can't say it caused mine."
361,Simponi (golimumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,8,"I have Ankylosing Spondylitis which was diagnosed 4 years ago due to a very bad case of Uveitis. I was given three TNF blockers without success. I was offered Simponi and this one worked, the pain went away after a few days and I was very happy about that as AS is very painful and it explains why I had a sore back for most of my life. I am now 58yo. I did not get any side effects but it did raise the blood pressure which I already have hypertension so it's made that worse and I can not get my BP under control.  It did not stop the Uveitis from reoccurring but overall it has worked well."
362,Simponi (golimumab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,6,"My husband took his first dose last month and is getting ready to take his second dose in a few days.  While I think the drug is working, the Patient Cost Support Program is difficult to deal with and we are still struggling to get reimbursement."
363,Simponi (golimumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,8,"Been on Simponi for 8 years. Has been amazing turned my life around. It can get sore within a week of injection but not sure if that can be helped.

Tried Enbrel and Humira previously but they only worked for 6 months for me."
364,Simponi (golimumab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,9,"It seemed to work well for me right from the start.  I had been on Remicade previously but I had to quit due to losing my insurance.  By the time I went to Simponi I was hurting pretty bad.

Unfortunately, it stopped working after a while (18 months) but that has been my personal experience with Biologics.  When it worked, it worked well."
365,Simponi (golimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,5,"I started taking infusion about 20 months ago.
First year things appeared to go smoothly.  Then I started experiencing weakness in right shoulder. Physical therapist diagnosed muscle deterioration and spent 3 months in therapy. Regained some of the strength then slipped and fell breaking ankle bone on both sides requiring surgery, pins, and plate in ankle. Never had a broken bone before!!
It went down hill from there. Have had 2 infusions since and have had weakness in other shoulder, urinary infection. Horrible headaches, knees giving out and painful, sore wrists.  Tire easily, weight gain, Blu-ray vision at times.  I think it’s time to re-evaluate the benefits of this drug as I have went downhill quickly the past year"
366,Simponi (golimumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,10,"Having suffered with Ankylosing Spondylitis for 10 years and with vast peaks and troughs in pain and the awful Methotrexate for 4 years with loads of side effects, I can honestly report Simponi has simply transformed my life. It's reduced swelling so well on my once sore toes I have excess skin, I'm running and active, I don't get any morning stiffness and NO SIDE EFFECTS thus far, it has cleared up my Psoriasis as well which sometimes returns towards the end of a month as you'd expect. The delivery method is far superior to methotrexate."
367,Simponi (golimumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,1,"Simponi did not work for me.  Tried it three months, and it made all the bleeding, cramping and diarrhea worse.  I really wanted it to work for me...but it didn't. And Jannssen was NO help...called it ""side effects,"" when it was ""exacerbation of symptoms.""  

Best wishes if you take it...I hope you find success with it.  :)"
368,Simponi Aria (golimumab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,2,"No pain or skin issues after 3 days, but about 2 weeks after the first injection I got sick for the 1st time. The fatigue set in at week 3. I was well again at week 4 right in time for my next dose. Once again by week 3 I was sick with the worst throat /adenoid infection that just wouldn't quit. The fatigue is life changing. Dr. took me off after my second throat infection in 6 weeks."
369,Simponi Aria (golimumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,9,I have been taking Simponi Aria for my ankylosing spondylitits AS. So far it has worked great. It’s definitely the best one I have been on. The only reactions I have had was in the beginning. I have asthma and that was triggered the first two treatments song with a racing heart. I do feel depressed on day 7 which is really weird but that has been a side effect for me with all biologics.
370,Simponi Aria (golimumab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,1,"I received Simponi Arianinfusions from 12/2018 to 6/2019. I’ve had 4 UTI’s the last infection on 9/2019 went to my kidneys, I was hospitalized with Sepsis. Now I’ve been referred to a Hemotologist due to High Myelocytes. I always feel sick, tired, weak...I’ve also been prescribed Lipitor for extremely high Cholesterol. I’m a vegetarian and eat healthy. I’ve never had this problems prior to Simponi Aria Infusions."
371,Simponi Aria (golimumab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,1,"Was doing fine for about 12 weeks. Then I broke out with a Whole new form of palmoplanter pustule psoriasis and my regular plaque psoriasis came back almost vengeful to the point where my skin feels like it is burning. I had my first infusion in Aug, the again the second one 4 weeks later and by the middle of my 8 week stretch was when these rashes happened. 
My first three days after the infusion I experienced vomiting, and extreme tiredness but overall I felt fine. The second infusion was pretty much the same but then all this happened.
I am so sore on my hands and feet it feels like I am walking or touching broken glass. I have to  wear vinyl gloves to keep the moisture on my hands and keep my feet wrapped with non stick gauze and taped and covered so I don’t developers a secondary type of infection from something else. I can’t take the pain so my husband has pushed me to hire a cleaning lady to do my housework because all I am able to do it lay around. This is no way to live."
372,Simponi (golimumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,10,"Well, I would like to say Simponi has been very effective for me.  From my first shot to the sixth the shot I just received this month the Simponi removed my symptons of AS to the point where I feel normal.  Before being diagnosed and receiving Simponi I was in pain constantly and taking meds that were basically for gout which what I was being treated for before my diagnosis for AS. One month the doc tried Remicade but it was ineffective for me.  The Simponi has given me back normality at least in the sense of physical well-being. It has been wonderful for me and my family as they don't have to worry about helping me when I have symptoms of swelling and pain. In fact I noticed that When i get scratches my wounds even heal faster. Thanks,"
373,Simponi Aria (golimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,5,"I was dx with sero positive RA nearly 35 years ago and have been on just about every NSAID, dmard, infusion and combinations of these. Simponi Aria along with lefunimide is my current cocktail. While it seems to be keeping my joint pain under control, my fatigue is off the charts and I have lots of body aches, frequent headaches and gastro problems. My bp and glucose levels are also elevated, though I'm not sure if this is due to this medication, or not."
374,Simponi (golimumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,7,I have had a hard time with drugs for my ankylosing spondylitits (A/S) and I thought Simponi was going to be the miracle one . The problem is that it doesn't last the full term they say it does. I have 5 weeks of feeling pretty darn good and 3 weeks of suffering. The infusion is supposed to last 8 weeks.
375,Simponi (golimumab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,10,"An absolute life changer. From living in excruciating pain each day  and struggling to get out of bed - to being absolutely pain free in a matter of only 3 months. No limitations as to what I can do physically, and the psoriasis on my scalp has cleared significantly. I have slight hand tremors but that causes my no trouble and may be due to other causes (23 years old, dosage  once every 4 weeks)"
376,Simponi (golimumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,8,"I have narcolepsy and ankylosing spondylitis, I also suspect that I have Psoriasis on my scalp, but haven't had it diagnosed officially yet. Simponi relieves some of the pain and discomfort from the AS and I usually have no lesions on my scalp while I am using the injection regularly. I also take 5 tabs of methotrexate weekly (along with all the side medication that goes along with these).  I recently came down with a bad cold and was taken off these medicines temporarily.  Immediately upon missing my injection my symptoms were back.   The lesions started to appear on my scalp and are pretty bad.  I would say that my quality of life has significantly improved since starting the Simponi about a year and a half ago.  I take one injections per month."
377,Simponi (golimumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,1,"Took only 2 injections! After the second became very ill had a 104 temp and then ended up in the hospital with a spinal infection! I then was transported to a specialty hospital 2 hours away via ambulance, due to increasing swelling of the spinal cyst I developed full of infection and they feared I may need intubation, but cervical spine is fused so I needed to be at a different hospital!
I spent a total of 14 days in hospital 10 of which in ICU , then 14 weeks at home with a picc line and heavy duty antibiotics! All due to simponi!!!!!!!
This almost bankrupt our family,I almost lost my LIFE and job! "
378,Simponi (golimumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,9,"Simponi is my 4th TNF blocker that I have tried. Upside- I have no pain anymore and I am grateful for that. I have not experienced any side effects and have been on it for 7 months now. I guess I will continue to use it until there is a reason not too. Downside- it killed my sex drive and has made my testicles shrink and I now produce very little sperm, my stomach has bloated since starting Simponi also."
379,Simponi (golimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,1,"I started Simponi infusions , just recently my first infusion was fine, made me a bit tired but no side effects and no effects at all, my 2nd infusion was 3 weeks ago, I again was tired after the infusion but I was more tired than usual , I started not feeling real great, the next day I felt even worse I believe every side effect that this drug has I had, fever, cold chills, nausea, extremely fatigued, headache, my whole body has and still is swelled up 2 x more than normal, having trouble breathing I then ended up with sinus infection and then pneumonia. Let me say that I have been dealing with RA/Fibromyalgia for the past 23 years, I have been on everything and anything that is available as suffice to say nothing has worked for me, however I never had any side effects to this magnitude with the others. I am glad this works for others and was really hoping to finally get some relief but I guess my body is rejecting this medication so I feel I had better listen to it."
380,Simponi (golimumab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,1,"I was on Remicade infusion for 7 years,  I had wonderful results for 6 years, with PSA flares slowly creeping back in the 7th, but not unmanageable.  Rheumy switched me to Simponi.  After 2 injections, while my skin is still clear, the PSA is raging.  I am in terrible pain.  I spoke the my Rheumy once and she said to give it a chance.  Calling her again this morning.  The pain and exhaustion is debilitating and affecting every aspect of my life.
I asked he about Taltz and Cosentyx but she wanted to keep me on a TNF blocker.  I'm ready for change."
381,Simponi (golimumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,9,"Simponi helps me so much. 
I take 2 shots per month. 
I Washington diagnosed about 7 or 8 years after mycket first signs of illness. Ive had it very hard. 
I get oxycontin when i have it too hard. But all in all, simponi is The best. I got a new life with it. 
Works as a chef, and without simponi i would not. 
I live in sweden, so i only pay about $300 a year. 
Or else i would have to pay ALOT. like $4000 per month. 
The negatives with this med, you cancer get alot of crap from it. 
But the pain i had before was crazy. 
Thank you my sweet Dr."
382,Simponi (golimumab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,1,"I have now just taken my 4th injection, I'm as bad as I was if not worse than when I was first diagnosed.  I can barely walk, have swelling in my toes, feet and ankles, as well as my left knee.  Also in my elbows, wrists, hands and fingers ... I have bad psoriasis on my scalp.  I don't think this medication is very good at all and have shown no response to the previous 3 doses and this dose I have been nauseous every since taking it .. I was on Humira previously for about 5 years but I stopped responding and Embrel I had really bad reactions too ... Hoping for something new when I go back to specialist end of month"
383,Simponi (golimumab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,5,"I took Simponi for 8 months before stopping to get pregnant with my son. All of my symptoms had disappeared and I was 100% flare up free. 
However, after having my little guy and starting the Simponi injections again I have not had any relief to my psoriasis and have experienced 2 flare ups even after upping my dose to every 3 weeks. How can it have worked so well and now not well at all. I have requested an appointment with my rheumatologist to discuss other biologic medicines."
384,Simponi (golimumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,8,"I'm suffering light to moderate AS for 8 years and pain comes with activity. I used only once, seems like its good for 3 months for me. I was suffering light cough and shortness of breath due to cold when I did the shot. Pain gone in couple days, life quality increased noticeably but cough and shortness of breath continued heavily for 2 months. Make sure you have no cold symptoms before you make the shot."
385,Simponi (golimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,1,"I've had 2 Simponi infusions. Recently I started breaking out with hives, especially  on my legs and feet. Sometimes on my arms and backs of my hands. It itches terribly, but clears up within 30 minutes to an hour. But it's been happening everyday for about 2 weeks now. Is this a common side effect of this drug?"
386,Simponi Aria (golimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,2,I have had 3 infusions and I am tired all the time and just want to sleep. My vision has also been more blurry.  I  understand the immune system can be lower on Simponi.  I now have the shingles on my face and I had the shingles vaccine two years ago. I have had RA for 33 years and Plaquenil has helped me more than anything as far as stiffness and pain. Have been taking it for at least 20 years. I also take celebrex and methotrexate.
387,Simponi (golimumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,6,"I've been diagnosed with AS since 2010, but symptoms started since 2008. Started Simponi last month & was on my 2nd shot last week. 1st shot had been great but after the 2nd shot, I am experiencing constant dizziness."
388,Simponi (golimumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,1,"Faced severe neurological and ophthalmological side effects after first injection of Simponi
Reduced/blurred vision, constant dizziness, unsteadiness, balance issues, cognitive problems, tremors etc. It’s been two weeks after injection.. still facing all these side effects."
389,Simponi Aria (golimumab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,6,I’ve been on Simponi Aria infusions. They have helped with pain and stiffness for Approx 4 weeks. I take prednisone for break through pain. Sometimes I sleep for 72 hrs because of fatigue. Have had to add another HBP Rx! Praying for strength to discontinue.
390,Simponi Aria (golimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,1,I had to take Simponi for a brief time due to a change in insurance. I was taking Enbrel previously and was almost symptom free. Simponi did not help my RA at all! I took it once a week for about 8 weeks. I decided to pay the extra monthly expense for the Enbrel!
391,Simponi (golimumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,1,"I have UC, fibromyalgia, RA, Diabetes type 2, and many more health issues. 
 I've been on SIMPONI for about 4 months, my symptoms have become worse, chronic pain, intense swelling burning tingling hands and feet, BLOATED STOMACH that just won't deflate,l oss of appetite, I don't want to have the SIMPONI ANYMORE, I'M now worried, and scared, as  it's rejected my body ,I have just about had enough of the intense pain...I'm happy to hear good results from people it has worked for..."
392,Simponi Aria (golimumab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,3,"I'm exactly 19 days after first Simponi aria infusion. I'll never take it again. I've developed some type viral infection in my inner ear /vestibular nerve that put me in the hospital for four days. Woke up 3am on day 14 with extreme tinnitus, dizzy, vomiting, and now deaf in left ear. I believe the simponi caused this virus/sinus infection/labrynthitis to go bat crazy. Today I'm still 100 percent deaf in left ear with screaming tinnitis and very dizzy when standing. This causes infections that  you may already have , to go off the charts.  But how would you know if you have some kind of infection is starting. As far as my back pain, it has gone..but maybe because I've been laying in bed for a week. I don't know. Think very hard before taking Simponi. I know many have received relief from it. Weigh out your risk to reward with it."
393,Simponi (golimumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,2,Was diagnosed with osteoporosis in 2000 and ankylosing spondylitis in 2003.  I have been put on different medications for both. I have been on Simponi for about 6 months and have not noticed any improvement. It is easy to use but that is about all.
394,Simponi (golimumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,9,"I'm a 48 year old female that started showing symptoms at age 17, diagnosed at 19 with the HLA-B27 marker. Total hip replacement at 29, chronic chest pain due to fusing. I have tried a butt load of meds over the years, most oral due to lack of insurance (Which thankfully, I now have) which cost me renal failure stage 2 including Methotrexate. I have a Medtronic pain pump and am on Oxycodone currently too. I have tried Enbrel, Humira and now Simponi. Simponi works very well for me WHEN I can get the smart injections to work. "
395,Simponi Aria (golimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,2,"Simponi Aria was no help in joint pain. Feel stupid, I have very hard time understanding people, my eyesight changed  worse. I see objects but it takes me awhile to comprehend what I am looking at. I limit my driving as I worry crashing. If it’s like this I rather die, as I can’t do my work. Already like being by myself but not feeling like an idiot."
396,Simponi (golimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,"Diagnosed with RA March of 2020 at age 65, hit me like a Mach Truck. Would have been in a wheelchair within a year. Started on methotrexate, which got me maybe 90% there. After 6 months started the Simponi, feel completely normal now. Stopped  the methotrexate in February.  It is now August 2021 and feeling great, no restrictions - workout all the time. Do it as  an IV every 60 days."
397,Simponi (golimumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,1,"Had 1st shot of Simponi and didn't notice any change. I was also taking 2 pills of methotrexate. Doc upped methotrexate to 6 pills. I had been getting muscle spasms intermittently since starting Simponi. After 3rd shot, I got the muscle spasms the next day and they lasted for a week. Doc took me off Simponi due to the muscle spasms and also because I didn't notice any change in AS. "
398,Simponi (golimumab) for Spondyloarthritis,9,"Been on this for 2 and a half months. After the second injection, I went 13 days without taking any Norco or Soma whereas I typically took one a day and two a day respectively. It took a bit to get my insurance to cover it, but I had a severe reaction to Humira allowing me to. Amazingly it seems to work even better than my enbrel at 11 weeks."
399,Simponi (golimumab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,4,I tried the injection once before after coming off of another biologic that made my symptoms worse. I did not really give it a chance as I did not seem to get any better. I was frustrated with my symptoms and took myself off of everything for 3 months. I had terrible joint pain could not open anything up and severe rash flare up so I tried it again with better results so far will be on my second consecutive dose shortly. The only thing I have found odd and maybe unrelated is heart flutters and an upset stomach.
400,For Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,"I'm 27, and have had RA for 6 years. I've been on a few medications (Plaquenil, celebrex, methotrexate) to find the best fit for me. I have been taking Simponi injections once a month (as well as 20mg MTX weekly) for 7 months now and I've had great success! Very slight pain in my foot by the end of the month, but nothing like what I've been through before. I exercise regularly and don't have any kind of pain, so happy. The only side effect I've noticed is fatigue, which can be challenging to manage at times, but I also really like naps, so if that's all I have to manage I'm OK with that! My doctor says he's hoping he can start lowering/removing my dose of MTX soon too!"
401,Simponi (golimumab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,1,I have gotten worse while taking this drug.  My skin is far worse and I’m incredibly itchy.  I’ve suffered 2 severe middle ear infections and pustule psoriasis that I never had before in places I never had problems.  I took 4 doses all together.  The side effects are not worth it for me.  I’m happy it works for some people unfortunately I am not one of them.
402,Simponi (golimumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,10,"I've  got UC started therapy with Simponi almost two years ago because I was a steroid-dependent, even if I generally felt well. The last colonoscopy, done 6 months ago, showed that I was in complete remission and luckily I still feel great. I haven't noticed any collateral effect, maybe I've just gained some weight, but probably I was underweight before (I am 1,63m tall, and my actual weight is 51,5kg)."
403,Simponi (golimumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,10,Simponi has been a God send! Prior to starting Simponi I was unable to leave my home for any length of time. I had suffered for 2 years with UC and failed other treatments. My last C- scope in November 2020 was  the best of the last 4. ❤ If I had one suggestion it would be to package an alcohol swabs with each injection ( like Humira does).
404,For Psoriatic Arthritis,2,"I started on Simponi 16 months ago and got the Simponi infusion every 2 months. 

Mid summer I suddenly got underarm itching and now 6 months later I have severe itching on my back,  neck shoulders and abdomen.  
I bleed from scratching and then scabs all over those areas. 

But there is no rash or hives. 

Unfortunately last week I had another infusion and wish I hadn’t. 

Needless to say, I’m miserable to say the least. 

I’m scratching incessantly and have been to 5 different medical specialists who are not sure what is causing it. 

Has anyone else had this problem. 

Thanks!"
405,Simponi Aria (golimumab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,1,"Started infusions of Simponi Aria about two years ago when Medicare wouldn’t cover Enbrel, which worked for me for 20 years. At first the infusions seemed to work. Then, about 6 months ago I came down with pneumonia, followed immediately by shingles, both caused by lowered immune system. A month ago I came down with pneumonia again, also caused by lowered immune system. I believe this drug is dangerous, and would rather deal with the pain than risk my life."
406,For Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,I have used Simponi Aria area for nearly one year and what a difference it has made in my life I have chosen quality of life versus quantity I am just about nearly normal again. It has given me the quality of life and hopefully the quantity of life that I so desperately needed I am 61 years old
407,For Rheumatoid Arthritis,3,"So far, no good.  Although I've only had my second infusion today.  2nd month.  I was diagnosed with RA over 10 years ago.  I've tried a number of biological's with enbrel working best, but I can't afford that.   I've had side effects with most of them, from dangerous blood pressure levels to diverticulitis.  I have sharp generalized joint pain, meaning all over, almost every joint.  Worse in my shoulders now, but that could change to other joints.   I feel like my entire body is sprained and fatigued.  The golimumab, or ""simponi"" as the brand name, has not yet started working for me.  After my infusion today I got really severe burning in my chest and throat, as well as a head ache and fatigue.  That has settled down now,  four hours later.  I also feel a little sad.  Has anyone else felt sad?  I don't know if this is due to the medication or not.  I'll check back and revise my review if this stuff kicks in any better."
408,Simponi (golimumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,1,"Been on Simponi for 3 months 5 tubes. I think I’ m worse than before. Bloating and going to toilet more often! I’ll give it another 3 months, but I can tell its not working. I know someone who also had no success with simponi, but might with Humira."
409,For Ankylosing Spondylitis,5,"I was diagnosed three years ago with Ankylosing spondylitis, I first started with enbrel which I had some success with and the dr ordered me to stop the injectors due to a delayed skin reaction, be decided to go with the remicade infusion which ended up landing me in the hospital 24 hours after infusion due to delayed hypersensitivity reaction involving swelling of my throat, lips, eye lids and hives, after a brief hospital stay I had to take several weeks of steroids and benedryl to bypass the infusion until it was out of my system, I refused treatment for a year until last Thursday I received my first infsuion of simponi , I've had very minimal side effects nausea , dizziness, BUT I am already feeling the difference!! This drug is amazing"
410,Simponi Aria (golimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,8,"I have had 3 infusions and I felt good after the first one. I don’t feel tried and have no pain. I do have 1 eye that twitches, eyelashes and eyebrows are falling out. The skin around my neck and around my hair line is red, itchy, scaly and numb around hair line. My face is slightly red and swollen"
411,Simponi Aria (golimumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,9,I was on Enbrel for 14 years I started Simponi aria this week and after my first infusion I am 75% better. This medication is amazing for people who suffer from A.S. Like myself. I would highly recommend. Talk with your Rhuematoligist Doctor to see if this will work for you too!!! Dave
412,Simponi (golimumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,7,"Been on Simponi for over 10 years. It has worked miracles with my UC. Full remission.
Now I have major joint pain. It started about a year or so ago in my left thumb joint. Now the pain is in every joint except one shoulder all within the last 8 months.
I have no Idea what is going on but the pain from the joints is becoming greater by the day. The docs say age. I'm 62 and no history of RA in the family but who knows."
413,For Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,"Hi guys I seen a lot of negative comments which scared me and I thought I would share my experience with ankylosing spondylitis and Simponi. When I was 25 years old I had pain in my buttock turned out to be ankylosing spondylitis I was prescribed naprosyn and the pain came and went. I took tablets when necessary when I hit 36 years old the tablets did not work anymore and the flare ups were really intense and lasted a lot longer. I was given Simponi by my rheumatologist and it’s been 3 years no problems and I am like a new man, like I was 18 again. I so am thankful it has worked for me and I hope it works for others."
414,For Ankylosing Spondylitis,8,"I am 30, have suffered AS for 6 years, diagnosed 6 months ago. 
In Australia this medication under the PBS costs $41/mth. 
At first the meds healed Psoriasis lesions I'd had for 10 yrs but they are coming back.

Started on 4 weekly, just been moved to 3 weekly injections. I was needing a top up at the beginning of week 4. My inflammation markers were up to pre Simponi levels.

The meds work well to prevent pain in the nights.
I am so stiff by day & have a terrible pain in my left hip.

When I am on my menstrual cycle my AS comes back for the first few days which is unbearable, reliving what this medicine generally delivers me from.

For the 1st 3 months the medication did give me lightheadedness, all day, & balance issues at night. However that has subsided finally.

Overall this medication has given me some quality of life back, but I can definitely feel my body seizing, the only relief is at night stopping the constant waking provided it isn't 'that time of the month.'"
415,Simponi (golimumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,10,"I was skeptical about trying Simponi at first.  But i'm glad my rheumatologist encouraged me.  It works awesome! Made me realize what ""normal"" is again.  I take 50mg every 3 weeks."
416,Simponi (golimumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,9,Works good and helps mobility. you can feel it working in 2-3 days. Also the injection process is quick and pain free. Thanks for the second chance at a bearable life.
417,Simponi (golimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,9,"Second injection today, after first injection felt results in two weeks. I am very happy."
418,Simponi (golimumab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,10,No pain after second injection.  98% clear.  Only side efferct so far is nausea at times.  Love this so far.  Humira and Enbrel caused bad site reactions.
419,Simponi Aria (golimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,10,"Amazing. I noticed a difference after my first infusion, So thankful to have the use of my hands back (musician). No side effects at all."
420,Simponi (golimumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,1,Got severe blurred vision and severe respiratory infections after taking Simponi.
421,Simponi (golimumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,9,Simponi has helped my symptoms tremendously. I did not have to take methotrexate along with this. I am very happy to be almost pain free. But I do notice maybe psoriasis beginning on my scalp.
422,Simponi Aria (golimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,8,I think it makes me sad. This was my 3rd dose and I'm almost suicidal.
423,Simponi (golimumab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,5,Worked ok on aches and pains but really messed with me mentally. Made me very depressed and socially withdrawals. I feel more fatigue and lot of headaches.
424,Simponi (golimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,5,It seems to have calmed down inflammation in my hands but my feet and knees and elbows still hurt.
425,Simponi (golimumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,1,"I had 3 injection of Simponi but so far no sign of any improvement. 
I am not sure whether I will take the 4th injection. The review of Simponi is good but unfortunately, it has not worked for me."
426,Simponi (golimumab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,1,It got worse on this
427,Simponi (golimumab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,1,I received all of the side effects. 
428,Simponi (golimumab) for Ankylosing Spondylitis,1,"Got severe neurological and optho side effects after 1st injection. Blurred/reduced vision, Dizziness, Unsteadiness, Cognitive problems etc.,"
429,Simponi (golimumab) for Spondyloarthritis,1,"Simponi caused reduced vision, neuro side effects and upper respiratory infection."
430,Simponi (golimumab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,10,Works Great
431,Simponi (golimumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,1,Simponi did nothing. Was actually better before I started!
432,Simponi (golimumab) for Rheumatoid Arthritis,4,Does not to work as well as other medication
433,For Rheumatoid Arthritis,4,Good for the first 3 years but starting to loose its effectiveness. Very expensive most insurance company refuses to cover the cost. So it's great if you are wealthy or have great insurance.
434,Simponi Aria (golimumab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,10,I had a good results with this medication. It relieved a lot of fatigue I was having. I have a lot less joint pain.My mobility have improved greatly.
435,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,7,"I was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis (UC)  in 2003. I landed myself in the hospital during my initial diagnosis, for 1 month. Remicade saved me, but the side effects were awful. Stopped that and was in remission for 15 years. I had a flare in April 2020. I ended up in the hospital during this pandemic. Good times! Anyway, started taking prednisone and my gastro put me on Entyvio. I've had 3 infusions since May 2020 and I'm due for my next infusion in September, but I don't know if I can handle these side effects? My UC is under control, but at what cost? I just turned 40, I'm very active and would consider myself fairly fit/strong. I can barely walk after sitting for 5 minutes. My ankles swell up, my joints hurt to the bone. I'm so exhausted ALL THE TIME. I'm also a teacher and I will be starting back up with school in a few weeks. I cant imagine being on my feet all day. Does anyone else experience this level of joint pain on Entyvio? "
436,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,10,"Entyvio was prescribed for my 8yr old son who was diagnosed with UC a little over a year ago. We have tried mesalamine, Remicade, Humira, budesonide, enemas, prednisone, GAPS / SCD diet. Mesalamine helped for a very short time, as did prednisone. My son is a primary non responder to both Remicade and Humira. He’s been hospitalized twice since diagnosis and his UC became much worse over the last 6 months. He was given Entyvio off label as it’s not typically prescribed for children. So far it has been a miracle drug for my child. After his second infusion he is so so much better. He has energy, a good appetite, and much less frequency. We can actually leave the house again for longer than 30 minutes. His only side effect so far is chronic runny / stuffy nose. Though he had this with both Remicade and Humira. He also suffered horrible migraines with previous biologics. None so far with Entyvio."
437,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,10,Entyvio has saved my life. Prior to being diagnosed with UC they were treating me for diverticulitis with antibiotics which made everything worse. I was out of work the entire month of October ‘18. My hair was falling out in blobs prior to Entyvio due to the malnutrition I was suffering because my intestines could not absorb nutrients from what little food I could eat and keep in my body and I lost 37 pounds in a month. After starting Entyvio I could eat food again and started taking Biotin and a multi-vitamin.  My hair stopped falling out and I have been on the road to recovery for the last 10 months.
438,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,3,"I was on a dual therapy of Entyvio and Xeljanz. I noticed slight hair shedding during the 3 loading doses of Entyvio. The day after the 4th dose, I started losing a TON of hair. Eight weeks later, I have lost almost 90% of my hair and am looking into hair extensions/wigs. I experienced hair loss with both Remicade and Humira, but not to this extent. Hair loss should be listed as a side effect. I am discontinuing Entyvio and am hoping it will be completely out of my system soon. Has anyone else experienced significant hair loss? When did it stop/grow back??"
439,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,10,"I have suffers UC for 14 years. I have tried everything and it would work for a short while and then I flared-up again. Remicade gave me bad side effects. Stopped and tried good diets and natural means for a year. I had an infection and caused my UC to come back and I was very sick for few months. My doctor put me on Entyvio and it took three or four months  for the medicine to work. I have been taking it every four weeks for a year and now I feel excellent, I have not felt this good in years. 
For side effects I had once a terrible headache and sometimes it feels like a cold. I always lost a lot of hair with prednisone and after flares, I have my hair back now, gained weight and feel very strong."
440,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,2,"I’ve had UC for 37 years.I’ve been on Entyvio for 12 months. I chose to stop due to the debilitating side effects. I am in remission now, however the side effects are not worth it. After my first infusion I felt I was having a heart attack. The EMTs said my heart was fine but I was close to having a stroke. Cortisone injections eliminated this symptom. Over 8 treatments I developed severe bone and joint pain, some hair loss, major skin dryness and bruising, extreme fatigue, extreme chills and sweats, mouth sores constantly, 24/7 nausea and loss of appetite, some tremors, depression, boils appeared including around my eyes. I developed a serious eye infection after the 8th injection.The ophthalmologist said he’s only seen this type of eye infection in chemo patients .My olfactory senses became affected. Food started tasting different and fragrances seemed off. Entyvio did work but it’s clearly a toxic drug to where the quality of life is impacted severely in my case."
441,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,10,30 years with ulcerative colitis. Tried it all even humira. Was on the verge of having my colon removed and dr suggested that I try entyvio. Had immediate results and after 6 months still symptom free. Been a miracle drug for me and changed my life around
442,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Crohn's Disease,10,"I've been dealing with Crohn's for 20+ years.  Through most I've been on oral meds such as Sulfasalizine, Imuran and Asacol.  These meds sort of controlled the symptoms but I still had flare ups.  Almost 2 years ago, I moved on to Entyvio.  Life has been so much better, as I don't have to plan my day where all the restrooms are along my sales route.  My colon actually had beautiful healthy pink tissue during my last colonoscopy.  I would recommend Entyvio to anyone with Crohn's to try before Remicade or Humira as Entyvio's side effects are less."
443,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,9,I was diagnosed with UC in 2017. I tried several medications with only partial reduction in symptoms. I have been on Entyvio for about 1.5 years now and my results are much improved with no side effects. I don’t get tired after injections and think I get a cold about as frequently as before starting Entyvio. I still get the occasional minor flare where I have some urgency or have to make a few extra trips to the bathroom a day but all in all I am in a much better place. I hope I can continue to use Entyvio for a long time.
444,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,2,"I tried Entyvio after failing on Remicade for moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. The first time it seemed to help but had an insurance issue and had to go on Humira. I lost all of my hair after taking Entyvio, but it was several months later. Humira didn't work at all, so they put me back on Entyvio. Almost 15 months later. It didn't work at all and made the diarrhea even worse. Besides that, I didn't notice side effects. Well, several months later all of my hair fell out again and after a year it still hasn't grown back. It might be worth trying if it is a last resort but I wish I never tried it because I had no curative results or relief and I am so depressed that I am a bald woman. They need to let people know that permanent hair loss is a possible side effect of Entyvio. They push these drugs to market so fast that people are basically guinea pigs and long term side effects are not revealed until years later."
445,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Crohn's Disease,8,"My Crohn's was diagnosed in 1978.
Started Entyvio in June 2019. Have had the 3 loading doses and am now on the 8-week infusion schedule.
Although my Crohn's symptoms have abated, I am experiencing unpleasant side effects: constant join pain especially in the neck and shoulders; severe headaches; blurred vision; cuts not healing; hot flashes; chills.
Not happy about the side effects but they are better than the severe abdominal pain and diarrhea."
446,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,9,"I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis at the age of 6. I'm 23 now. . I was started on Entyvio back in October, it took a while for the effects to really start helping me get over this flare-up. But it's well worth it. I feel alive again, and not just like a ghost who haunts the bathroom. 
The side effects are a little annoying, like living in a constant state of stuffy/runny nose, sneezing, headaches and the FATIGUE. The day of the infusion I will fall asleep immediately and sleep most of the day, and for the rest of the week I deal with it. At my most recent appointment, my doctor said I had color to my face and I seemed a lot more alive."
447,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,9,"I was referred to try Entyvio shortly into 2018 after being switched off Humira (taking 2 shots weekly). I had tried a majority of products on the market as of that time and it usually worked for a short period. You do feel some symptoms immediately after the infusion, primarily total fatigue and you usually sleep the rest of the day...or at least I do. Overall, the drug has done wonders for me as of lately. You still really need to watch what you eat, and restrain yourself from alcohol, but it’s worth it. I put back on the weight I lost from flare up and feel great."
448,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,,"I've been on Entyvio for 2 years for ulcerative colitis. Before that, I almost died from  being Septic. I tried Humira after that and I almost died of heart failure. Finally they put me on Entyvio. A miracle drug for me! I'm in 98% remission, having infusions every 4 weeks. My side effects are itching all over.. I started taking Vitamin E and it solved the itching. I have 2 choices, always running to the bathroom and not having a normal life, or keep taking this Life changing drug. I choose a better life with Entyvio."
449,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Crohn's Disease,9,I started Entyvio about 8 weeks ago for fairly severe Crohn's Disease. I have to say I have felt significantly better than I have in years and each week has yielded better symptom relief. Significantly less urgency and trips to the bathroom overall. I don't love the IV infusion route but the results have been worth it to me. I am hoping the at home self administered injections gets released later this year to eliminate the infusion inconveniences. Far better than Humira or Stelara worked for me and with less side effects.
450,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,5,"I have had UC since 2009. I have tried messalizine, imuran, remicade (for 4  months in 2013 after which I developed antibodies so had to stop) and entyvio (aug 2019 -nov 2019).   I tried entyvio in August 2019 after a stint in hospital in June 2019.  By 3rd infusion joint pains were unbearable so after 4 infusions I stopped.  In that time entyvio did help my symptoms by maybe 30 %. I shed hair on entyvio but it has recovered now. 6 months since my last infusion of entyvio  i still suffer horrible pains in wrists, ankles, fingers, elbows at all times of day and night. Usually one side only sometimes both sides equally.  The bones in my elbows hurt as though they have been badly bruised or someone took a hammer to them. I am waiting for test results to see if I have developed antibodies the same as i did with infliximab."
451,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Crohn's Disease,1,"My husband started entyvio a year ago at the recommendation of a new GI doctor. 4 months ago he got Giardia, two weeks ago he got Shegella. He is now in the worst crohns flare of his life. The GI doctor at the local hospital said based on the amount of inflammation this drug has never worked.  Don’t try this drug!  Doctors are only interested in the amount of kickback they are getting from the drug company."
452,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Crohn's Disease,5,"Started Entyvio for Crohn's disease (CD)- first drug I had tried. It worked very slowly, but I did experience slight improvement. Made it to my 3rd dose. Within 9 mins of my drip for my 3rd dose my throat closing, face got very hot turned bright red, heart beat went faint and had the sensation of passing out (maybe I did, don’t remember it all). Definitely felt like I was dying. 911 had to be called. 
2-3 hrs after the second dose I had the same reaction at home with heavy palpitations, but it would come and go. 
First dose I had a really weird sore throat."
453,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Crohn's Disease,1,"Never again..severe allergic reaction to 2nd Entyvio iv.  I've had Crohn's for 30 years and taken many different meds. I was recently diagnosed with liver cirrhosis F4 and had to stop methotrexate. I also take Apriso. My GI dr said I should start Entyvio. First infusion went fine. 2 weeks later I had my 2nd infusion. Within 2-3 minutes my chest tightened, throat started closing up, my face got extremely hot and throbbing and was swelling quickly.  The whites of my eyes turned completely blood red. The IV was immediately stopped and flushed with saline. Tried again with med going in slower. Immediately I started having the same symptoms. 3 weeks later I was given my first iv infusion of Stelara. Within 1 minute of the IV being started I had the same reactions but worse. I thought I was going to die. I refuse to take any more iv's."
454,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Crohn's Disease,10,I was hesitant to try this drug because of the reviews on this site.  I'm not sure why I put more more faith into the reviews here than my Doctor's and son's advice.  I finally tried the drug and it saved my life.
455,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,,I been taking entyvio  for year now and I am doing great I had uc (ulcerative colitis to 22 yrs now. I have been every medicine out nothing work for long but with this medicine I’m fine. The only side effect I experience is fatigue and a rash once in a while but I love this medicine I feel human again
456,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,,I was diagnosed with Ulcerative colitis (UC) 22 years ago. I was on medicines including ASACOL until I reached a remission that lasted for seven years and I thought I got back to normal and a flare up would never happen again until the last 7 months when I had the surprising flare and after the colonoscopy the doctor prescribed Prednisone and I took it for 3 months where I got better but with many side effects and they then said must continue with Humira as cortisone medicines must not be taken for so long. I started humira and had 7 injections with no improvement until they decided I should change to Entyvio on 24/01/2020 was my first infusion and until now my flare up is getting worse with no improvement and i feel so sick with severe abdominal pain and many bathroom visits a day..
457,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Crohn's Disease,9,"I have had IBD (Crohn's) for 15 years.  Flares only controlled by prednisone.  Failed Imuran and 6mp with pancreatitis. Had limited success with Uceris but no great inflammation control. Melsalamine never helped much. Got a new G.I. and he suggested Entyvio after a colonoscopy showed inflammation.  Former G.I. was hesitant to use biologics but I really was ready to try something new.  
I have had three induction I.V.s.  The I.V. is very easy.  I live close to the doctor's office and I am in and out less than 35 minutes. The only possible side effects are a scratchy throat and some mild itchy skin.  Both of these things could be unrelated.
The nurse warned my Entyvio is slow to take effect but I *believe* it is working for me.  My inflammation is greatly decreased and my guts have healed.  
So...if you are struggling with IBD and the doctor suggests this drug I would recommend trying it."
458,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,10,"After 6 days of my first  Entyvio infusion I was symptom free.  My hair had definitely thinned, I don’t care, I feel alive again.  I have been on for 8 months.  Life saving for me.  I’m 63 recently diagnosed.  Tired after infusion, take 2 Benadryl and go to bed!"
459,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,5,"I am due for my 4th injection of Entyvio in a few days. Towards the end of the 2nd infusion I started to feel worn out. Thought it must mean my body is in need of the 3rd. Since the 3rd infusion I have been suffering with chronic fatigue. It is debilitating which in turn messes with your mental health. Entyvio has almost eliminated my UC symptoms but at the price of my quality of life. Also experiencing hair loss & break outs. 
My G.I. Dr says fatigue isn't a thing or a side effect, my case worker at YOURVANTAGE says its a common side effect but to get 4 injections before stopping, my GP says maybe take a drug holiday.....I'm  at a lost as to what to do but leaning towards stopping."
460,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,8,"I’ve tried just about everything for Ulcerative colitis (UC) over the last 15 years. Most meds work for a while and then stop. After 12 months of Humira, which helped somewhat but was inconsistent, I started on Entyvio in April 2018. After the first 2 infusions, I felt much better. I was closer to remission than I have been in years after the Week 6 infusion and continued feeling great for about a year.  I’ve started having flares again and my Dr is considering going to more frequent infusions to get me back on track. The only side effect was some joint pain in my hands and wrists. It was severe at times but completely went away once I was on the maintenance doses."
461,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,4,"I was on Entyvio for 6 months. I had no symptoms during my loading doses and then it hit me like a rock!
I have episodes of stroke like symptoms. My hands would get sweaty, I get to where I feel like I'm going to pass out, lightheaded,  overall weird feeling. I couldn't even drive to work because of the attacks. Muscle aches, flu like symptoms and chronic sinusitis. Missed several weeks of work from episodes. 
I also developed a rectal abscess. 
I had an MRI to see what's going on and there's signs of minimal damage to my brain!!
I had none of this before ENTIVYO."
462,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,7,"I have had UC since 2010. I took Lialda for years then weaned off of it when I moved to Europe for a while. In December 2018, I had my 8 year since diagnosis colonoscopy and my GI couldn't believe I wasn't in the hospital with how inflamed my colon was. I was in pain but I learned to deal with it. Now, 7 months after starting Entyvio, I am wondering if the side effects are worth it. My colon is definitely better but I am constantly tired, my bones hurt, and I always seem to get sick a week or so before every infusion and wonder if I'll even be able to get it. The pain in my joints can be unbearable. I am going to see a rheumatologist to see if they can help me get this under control since my UC is finally in remission."
463,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Crohn's Disease,,"I had first dose of Entyvio 2/19/18.  I've had 3 doses so far.  I will not be having any more.  I  felt better before I started Entyvio.  I have gained roughly 15 pounds (do not need the extra weight).  Terrible body aches, especially lower back, little pimple like growths over my body, tired all the time.  Nope...this is not for me."
464,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,4,"UC since 2000.  Active working woman.
Was on Mezzavant with no flares for years. 2018: travel around world, got UC flare back home.  Checked for travel disease: NO. Started Entyvio. Intestinal problems gone and colposcopy was A1.  Entyvio side effects kicked in. 
Migraine, burning numbness on feet, hands, lower legs, finger joints popping, difficulty to walk on feet, extreme fatigue. All my data works are OK. IRM  OK. Vit. D  too low but OK now.  
I stop Entyvio NOW after 10 mths. Back on Mezavant with higher dose. 
will see  neurologist but I am sure (and my gen doctor also but not my gastro...) symptoms are linked to Entyvio.

My gen doctor made me keep a journal  daily symptoms 3mths, food,  events, medication. Shows clearly curves of migraine, fatigue and numbness getting really high for 14-20 days AFTER  injection and  staying low for the rest of 8 weeks. And back up again. can’t continue with  side effects."
465,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Crohn's Disease,1,"Entyvio caused a lot of pain to my body.  My joints started popping out of place. Started with my toes popping out of socket, I would have to pop them back in a couple times a day for over a month. My hip dislocated, shoulder, fingers, and jaw pop out of socket. I had hundreds of knots form in my back. I ended up being hospitalized for several days due to a partial bowel blockage, this was several months after starting Entyvio so it should've been fully built up in my system.  Entyvio was absolutely terrible in all aspects for me and I would never recommend it for anyone.  Don't waste your time, money, and health it."
466,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,10,"Entyvio saved my life, both social and physical. I went through Lialda, Uceris, Prednisone, Canasa, and so on! These drugs could only help the upper portion of my colon, but not my proctitis, pain, urgency, and tenesmus. Entyvio worked for me!! Symptom free after ONE dose :) Going in my 4th dose."
467,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,1,"I used entyvio for around 9 months for ulcerative Colitis. Not only did I lose ALL of my hair, 2 years later it has not grown back. I am bald on the top right and entire back of my head. I also lost my eyebrow hair and leg hair. I had no results with this drug and now I am devastated and depressed from being permanently bald."
468,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,8,Was on verge of having colon removed having tried humira and other treatments with no relief.  After 3 months on Entyvio started to get results. Symptoms are reduced but not eliminated. Quality of life is much improved. Have been on it over two years.
469,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Crohn's Disease,1,"I have struggled with Crohn's disease for many years. I have been able to lead a normal life with Remicade IV every 8 weeks was the best med. for me until now. Unfortunately, it stopped working. My GI doctor put me on Entyvio. I'm on my second dose and not happy. I'm very concerned. I'm having symptoms that set me back 15 years. I have nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, joint pain, skin lesions, headaches, blurred vision, and fatigue. Had to take off several weeks of work also. I would not recommend this medication. I'm working with my doctor now for a new plan."
470,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,3,"I have had UC for over 10 years. Was taking Asacol, which worked for years, then stopped working.  I have been on Entyvio for 6 months. It has helped my UC, but after a couple months of treatment, my knees were swelling. I am having so much pain in my knees now, I have trouble walking. I am stopping Entyvio, it’s not worth crippling myself."
471,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Crohn's Disease,,"Started entyvio because Dr said Humira wasn’t controlling my disease based on my last colonoscopy, even though I felt great! A month later I had a flare and was in the hospital. 5 months after the first infusion my hair started to fall out as if I was receiving chemo! Then I put on 20 pounds and can’t lose it to save my life. Now I’m  constipated all the time. And as if this wasn’t enough, the insistent itching began along with the coughing and sneezing. Dr got tired of hearing me complain and did another scope and my intestines are worse than they were before! Going to try Stelara next. Unfortunately, entyvio stays in the system for ages."
472,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Crohn's Disease,2,"I have been on Entyvio for 13 months. It doesn't seem to be helping the diarrhea or urgency.  I am fatigued, all the time. I am having LOTS of joint pain and weakness (fingers, wrists, toes, ankles, knees.)  I trip/fall because my ankles roll, I drop things because my fingers won't keep a grasp. I have been tested for RA - negative.  I don't think it is working, but my GI wants to try infusing every 4 weeks instead of every 8 weeks.  To me Entyvio is not worth the side effects."
473,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,5,I just wanted to write to thank everyone for their feedback and advice. My gut feeling was to not go in this even though drs told me entyvio Is the best safest thing (apparently not ). I have a friend who's decided to go on it about 3 infusions now and not well.  Severe joint pain and sore bones throughout as well as dealing with rash and possible other autoimmune conditions that have not been verified yet if it's drug related.  All symptoms are since being on Entyvio.   I'm so glad that I followed my instincts and not the drug's/Dr.   Hoping for some better options that are safer for all of us !
474,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,10,"This is the first UC drug that I've seen an immediate and significant improvement from. It has given me my life back. After a nasty flare over a long period of time, Entyvio had me feeling better within the first few weeks. I have been in remission for over a year taking this every 8 weeks, this is the longest remission streak I've ever had since being diagnosed 15 years ago. 

For a day or two after the infusion I am VERY tired, have some joint pain and headaches, but they are relatively mild compared to a UC flare. I also find if I am sufficiently hydrated before and after the infusion the side effects are far less severe."
475,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,2,"DO NOT TAKE ENTYVIO!!! That is of course unless you want your immune system to shut down and be unable to fight off even the littlest common cold. Not to mention the crazy amount of debilitating side-effects. Headaches, sore muscles, major fatigue, restless leg syndrome, feeling like you want to throw up out of the blue, back pain and coughing.  Oh and IF you do happen to get a cold while you're already experiencing these side effects, you might as well times the pain by 3 and prepare for a very long recovery as your body is too weak to fight off any disease.

As for my colitis symptoms..??  Entyvio almost TRIPLED my symptoms!!  CONSTANT diarrhea, NON-STOP abdominal discomfort and literally you are up all night.  AVOID BY ALL MEANS!"
476,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,9,"Entyvio has been a miracle for me! I had ulcerative proctitis that spread & my symptoms were terrible especially in the morning & were causing me depression, fear, & withdrawal from people.
Within 2 IV doses I noticed a profound reduction of all symptoms. Right now I am 95% symptom free.
I have not had any side effects except noticeable hair loss. I’m not sure if the hair loss is from the prednisone I was taking for 3-4 months until a week before I started Entyvio."
477,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Crohn's Disease,5,I have been on it for a little over 1 year.My crohns is better but I now have Severe Liver disease.I had a ct scan 10 months ago with mild fatty liver.A recent ct scan revealed Severe Liver disease.I am so annoyed! Be sure to ask questions and do your research.I would have rather lived with crohns than with a ruined liver!
478,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,1,"I thought Entyvio might have been the next best treatment, after I could no longer take Remicade and Humira. I started the injections in May and my ears started to bleed a week after the injection. After a month on the medication I have full body itching. Lastly, after five months on the medication I am also sneezing have patches of dark red angry rashes that are the size of a silver dollar. I would highly recommend close observation on this medication and speak to your doctor right away when any of these side effects occur. In my case they are only increasing with more exposure."
479,"Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Crohn's Disease, Maintenance",5,"Taking Entyvio every 8th week. Experiencing extreme fatique, tiredness, depression, lack of ""drive""/braintiredness. Sometimes I feel better for the last 2 to 3 weeks of the time-period.

Due to the Covid19 situation I had to wait an additional 2weeks for my dose in April and during this period all these side effects went away."
480,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Crohn's Disease,5,"The positives: my bowel movements have slowed down considerably. I have not lost weight. Less gut pain and urgency to use toilet.

The negatives: I feel uncomfortably hot sometimes, fatigue (although I have to say I am getting iron infusions because I’m anemic) gas can be bad( take protonix, gasx and Xantac.) Was on prednisone when I started Entyvio. Prednisone is heaven to me, but it is difficult coming down. I am afraid of this very strong drug, but I developed anti-bodies to Humira. Skipped any treatment for weeks, and went into Crohns Hell. (I wanted to stop eating.) No problems during and after injections Did get a mother of a sinus infection when I got last Entyvio injection early. 6 instead of eight weeks. I am having my eight week injection soon. We’ll see. If this one doesn’t agree with me, that will be it.
But, I have to eat at least and not lose weight fast. I can drop 10 lbs just like that when my Crohns is active!"
481,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,3,"After being allergic to all mesalamine drugs, remicade, and built up antibodies against Humira I was hopeful after my 4th treatment that I was finally in remission. Then the morning of my 5th treatment I go into the doctors office. About 15 minutes after my IV started I began to feel really light headed. I had a tight chest and my whole body felt heavy. This out of body feeling came over me and I was fixated on one spot of the room. Next thing I know I wake up to EMTs over me saying I had unresponsive pupils with hives. They said I was unresponsive to everyone around..I don't remember anything else until I got to the ER. If you start to feel dizzy-tell the nurse right away! Good luck to everyone."
482,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Crohn's Disease,10,"Have been on entyvio for well over 2 years. Crohns is under control with last colonoscopy showing significant improvement in large intestine.
Have some pain now and then but nothing to stop me getting on with life.
Only side effect I've experienced is being a little tired in evening after infusion.
Fortunately for me I live in the UK and my treatment is covered by NHS."
483,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Crohn's Disease,10,"Have been on entyvio for over a year,  without question it has saved my life. I struggled on and off for 30 years my last flare up was the worst,  unable to work or function outside the house for 3 years.  After a year I am 100 %  able to work and enjoy a normal life."
484,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,2,"I have only had one infusion of entyvio.
12 hours after the infusion the pain started. 
Severe colic like pain. Shaking and trembling.
Huge swollen legs and feet which diuretics won't help.
Very unsteady on my feet loss of balance and joint pain.
They told me there was practically no side effects of this drug.
I have been deceived."
485,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,8,"Neurologist told me Humira caused my chronic daily migraines so GI switched to Entyvio. I was already in remission due to Humira and 6 months later on Entyvio continue to be doing fine.  Other than a scratchy throat for the first couple of days after the infusion (and migraines gone!) I have experienced no other side effects. So far I am happy, however once I’ve been on it several years without a flare will truly determine if it is working."
486,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Crohn's Disease,8,"I was on Remicade for several years. I recently switched over to Entyvio. It seemed to be helping, but the benefits only lasted about 6 weeks. My Dr just added Methotrexate to help boost the effectiveness. So far seems to be working better than Remicade.

That said, everyone and every case is different. It comes down to you working with your doctor(s) to find the best plan for you. Don't give up, keep trying."
487,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,6,"Have been on vedolizimab for over 2 years now and it has been amazing at eliminating all gut-related symptoms (I have Ulcerative Colitis). But Over the 6 months or so though, I've been experiencing weird and horrendous neurological symptoms.  Tingling, crawling and burning as well pain and weakness. Seriously considering trying a new drug."
488,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,4,"I haven't been able to tolerate any drug during the 5 years I have been officially flaring and diagnosed with UC. Despite this I know I had this nasty thing for the past 20 years. To put it plainly, Humira worked for 2 months, then failed. Now Entyvio worked for 1 month maybe and seems to be placebo now. I oscillate between very bad bloating and constipation and then diarrhea. Since on Entyvio I am unable to sleep laying down from the pain, and I have no ability to form a normal stool - it's either Diarrhea or it's pencil thin or pebble like. I do not feel like this medicine works and is just another step in the long journey toward surgery. I hear how biologics help people but I remain unconvinced."
489,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Crohn's Disease,10,"I've been on Entyvio for aggressive Crohn's for 3.5 years and it has been great. It has erased my Crohn's symptoms completely. However, I want to switch to something that doesn't interfere with the immune systems as I have had Chronic Fatigue Syndrome for 4.5 years and can't exercise without getting sick for days. I think that there is a connection to biologics and CFS, which is my cause appears to be caused by the Epstein-barr virus. Lowered immune system, latent virus becomes activated etc."
490,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Crohn's Disease,10,"I've been on Entyvio now for nine months. Since I've been on the medicine I only experience Crohn's systems about once every week and a half in the evening around bed time. At that time I have diarrhea but after emptying, I feel fine.  I no longer am concerned about going out and eating or leaving the house and having an emergency with diarrhea; however,  for the last two weeks plus,  I've been fighting cold symptoms and although I maybe a little better,  I am beginning to wonder if I will ever get over the cold.  After reading the experiences of others, I am wondering if the Entyvio is complicating my recovery."
491,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,1,Developed UC and started Entyvio about 3 years ago.  Hair immediately started falling out.  Also severe sleeplessness and hot flashes.  Days of not sleeping or if I did it would only be for 2 or 3 hours.  Had 20 to 30 hot flashes a day in the last year I took it and they would last at least 4 to 5 minutes then I would get really cold.  My UC was completely under control but the side effects were more than I could tolerate.  Started Humira about 8 months ago but have already had 2 flares. Now I don't know why the Gastro doctor didn't start me on Humira instead of Entyvio.
492,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Crohn's Disease,9,"I have been on Entyvio for about a year and have had good results, although I did not see any reduction in pain until after the 4th infusion.  I was on Humria for 8 years before it stopped working at that point I stopped taking medications for 3 months - that was a mistake.  Was in pain all the time.  I do have some minor joint pain, but that could be just me aging.  I also have a lot of mucus in throat, but that may only be my lifelong struggle with bad allergies.  Everyone's body metabolites and reacts differently.  Some of reactions that people are having are listed as side effects and to contact dr immediately.  Overall I believe this drug is working for me, although I don't like putting it in my body and would like to try something more natural but I am afraid the pain will return."
493,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,7,"I started Entyvio for UC  as soon as it hit the market.  I became steroid resistant and just started Entyvio as my first biologic as it looked like it would have a better safety profile.   Has been great for my UC,  with no significant G.I. symptoms.  However, after about  2 years started having tremors on awakening and muscle fasciculations.  Not sure if from Entyvio or not.  Have stopped all other medications and had a  MRI, sleep study, EMG, nerve conduction tests.  ? Restless leg syndrome.  Neurologists so far do no think it is Parkinson’s or ALS.  Have had slight progression of symptoms for 2 plus years, but G.I. doctors nor the neurologists think it is related to the Entyvio and think I should continue using it.   However, I feel stupid for not trying to go off the medication and starting Remicaid or Humira for a year or 2 and see if symptoms resolve, although scared they my not work or lead to some other complications."
494,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,2,"I am a ulcerative colitis  (UC) patient and have a pouch. I was on remicade and recently switched over to Entyvio. I have only had two infusions so far and have also lost a LOT of hair. I couldn't tell if it was due to the Entyvio  or because I was flaring. I have had phases where I have lost hair. But nothing like this. Has anyone had this issue when they first started the drug and over time the hair has come back?

I have not noticed any improvement in my symptoms, hoping to see some changes once I get my third"
495,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,1,Been using Entyvio for two years for Ulcerative colitis. It has not helped my UC. My doctor will not stop giving it to me even though it is doing nothing. Next appointment is next week and I plan to stop using it or find another doctor.
496,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Crohn's Disease,9,I was put on ENTYVIO after my colon was removed and J pouch surgery and still had symptoms involving the pouch and area just above the pouch. I have been on ENTYVIO for 6 years. I started at 8 week intervals but over the last 2 years have had to go from 8 weeks to 6 weeks now at 4 weeks do to symptoms returning before next dose. Testing showed that at 4 weeks the level of ENTYVIO in my system was far below the recommended level. I hope that it continues to work for me. I started on Remicade in 2005 when I was diagnosed with U. C. I was on it a few years but ended up failing completely to help symptoms. I was then put on Cimzia which I did not respond to at all. I then was put on Humira. I was on it till 2010 when thyroid cancer was found. After thyroid was removed I was put on ENTYVIO. Due to the cancer I can't have imuno modifier medications. From Oct 2010 till early March 2013 I was on oral medication. Azacol I think it was or I was on that prior to the colon surgery.
497,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Crohn's Disease,1,"I decided to discontinue after the 4th infusion.  Very expensive which might have been worth it had it improved diarrhea.  Instead with each infusion ulcers in my mouth flared worse (they were already there - Crohns in the mouth), severe fatigue, all over body pain, worsened sinus problems, weird tendon-like pain in hands & feet. all of which got worse and lasted longer which each subsequent infusion.  My last infusion's symptoms lasted for weeks!"
498,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Crohn's Disease,9,"Very pleased with Entyvio. I've been in remission and the medication is working very well for me for the last 2.5 years. I do experience bad side effects that last about 24 hours after infusion including severe fatigue, headache, all over body pain. I have to say the pros outweigh the cons for me."
499,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,2,Been on now for 5 months. Symptoms returned 2 months in. Dr wants to give it a good try so I'm back on Cortiment and awaiting a scope that he only has time for in June. Lost a lot of hair which is somewhat devastating for a woman who wants to feel normal and keep disability invisible. Dizziness and muscle weakness to the point of gym workouts not recovering for days.  So now I'm torn bc if I stop the meds and he does a scope in June he could say well we don't know if it worked you didn't give it enough time. It's a mental drain always trying to fix yourself and I think most people here wouldn't buy a fancy car if they won  heaps of money but rather diagnostic equipment. If it was possible to see what's really going on in their bodies. The unknown sucks. Getting naturopathic medicine and support and trying ketogenic diet along with fodmap and medical marijuana to help cope with the depression. I hope it's enough to keep me off these meds
500,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,10,This my third medicine we have tried for my colitis I had a severe reaction too remicade after using it for two years. I then was put on cimizia which didn't work. I then was put on Humira  which didn't work. This medicine is my last resort and it has saved my life.
501,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Crohn's Disease,1,"I've suffered  from Crohn's for over 50 years. Experienced major flare-up in May 2017. Taken off current meds and prescribed 20 mgs of prednisone. Health improved immediately. Started tapering down until I was down to 5mg in March at which time started first injection of Entivyo. I am down to 1mg of predisone now. Have had two injections to date and scheduled for a third April, 2018 to be followed by another in June. I realize I have to give the biologic a chance to work but I have not noticed anything positive from the treatment to date. Always fatigued with low appetite and joint pain. Sometime I wonder if it wouldn't be in my best interest to simply go on prednisone and feel good for a few years. My GI is very optimistic regarding Entivyo so we will have to see what happens from here."
502,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Crohn's Disease,1,Entyvio never worked for me . I never had any joint pain so that was good but I had 7-8 doses until I changed to Xeljanz.  Entyvio gave me SEVERE fatigue and not so much on Xeljanz... also seeing improvement now.
503,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Crohn's Disease,8,"I have not been on it long enough. But it did control my diarrhea, not the pain. I was told because of my new diagnosis of Irritable Bowl Syndrome along with the Crohn's Disease, they are stopping the infusions to see if the pain is not a side effect from it. This is all I know about it so far. I hope this helps a little."
504,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Crohn's Disease,2,Only on my second injection migraine so bad I get nauseous ears ringing hear my heart beat in ears all the time its elevated constantly light hurts my eyes dizzy head goes black for seconds only going bathroom every three days scared to take my next dose
505,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,8,"Started Entyvio in November 2018, May 2019 began having muscle pain and fever of unknown origin. Went to emergency room in August 2019 diagnosis with Avascular Necrosis of bilateral femoral head. This type of bone disease is associated with high alcohol consumption and long term high dose steroids use. I have neither been a high consumer of alcohol nor had to use high dose steriods.  The doctor are denying its Entyvio but I'm 100% sure it has caused this avascular necrosis of bilateral femoral head . I have been on my medication regime since 2014 without any issues with the exception of my ulcerative colitis being in a flare. I'm stuck because entyvio helps for about 3 weeks."
506,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Crohn's Disease,6,"I am 67, male, 40 plus years of Crohn's Disease (CD). Several surgeries with only 5 feet of intestines remaining.  I have been taking Entyvio for about a year now.  It has worked to greatly slow the frequency and urgency of my diarrhea.  However the joint pain it caused in me has me debating whether it is worth it.  I have never had joint pain before and now I have trouble turning a door knob!"
507,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,6,"3rd infusion next week of  Entyvio seems to be helping the Ulcerative colitis (UC) but the attendant proctitis is very much the same (urgency, frequency). No major side symptoms but for serious fatigue. Why was I put on Entyvio before trying another drug?"
508,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Crohn's Disease,5,"Two years on it. Now having liver issues. Colon on recent colonoscopy was clear. Endoscopy showed esophageal varicies stage 1. Fiberscore Labs showed stage 4 fibrosis.  Fiberscan the same. Fatigue, general and gut pain continues. Weight is stable  but can't gain. Energy low.  May need a med break."
509,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,3,"I have tried almost every medicine there is even entyvio but one medicine that I guarantee will help you is taking suboxone. Please take my advice when you have a whole film of suboxone cut them in 4 slices take just a quarter. I guarantee u that the diarrhea, the pains and everything else will go away. Suboxone  for Ulcerative colitis has been a miracle drug for me and has helped me be on remission for about 4 years. Now I had it when I was 23 I took suboxone at the age of 24 and I have been amazed. Subozone is used to treat people with addiction but it can be a miracle drug to other sickness. Please take my advice and at least give it a try I promise u it will work better then any drug. The doctors have no idea what works because they are not rocket scientist and they don't have what we have. We on the other hand know what works n what doesn't"
510,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Crohn's Disease,,"Just had second treatment. My treatments have been every 2 weeks. Crohns is still the same no pain relief at all. 1 hour after infusion nausea starts, diarrhea, joint and muscle pain, stomach pain, hot flashes, tired but trouble sleeping. Not sure if this is right for me"
511,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,10,"After several years on Humira, I finally stopped receiving any benefit from it.  So, Entyvio was suggested.  I have been receiving Entyvio infusions for about 1.5 years.  The medicine worked right away for me and continues to be very effective."
512,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Crohn's Disease,3,"Started Entyvio in the middle of a flare up. I've had the most side effects from this one as compared to all past treatments. Frequent moderate-severe sinus headaches. Flushing, hot feeling. Took 9 months before we saw improvement but I was also on budesonide which might have been the cause of the improvement. Unfortunately it just doesn't seem worth it. I've heard better results for UC patients."
513,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Crohn's Disease,9,"I started Entyvio as my first biologic ever for Crohn's Disease. I was TERRIFIED of reactions and side effects. It turned out to be great. I get a headache and tired the day of the infusion and that’s it for me! After my third dose (they say the magic dose) I noticed a vast improvement in my Crohns symptoms! It also drastically decreased my CRP levels in a matter of weeks ! Unfortunately, 14 days and 9 hours after my third dose, my lips started to swell. They are thinking it’s a delayed reaction and taking me off the drug. A chance that the swelling is just an extra-intestinal manifestation of my Crohns (which entyvio does not treat because it’s gut specific) but they don’t want to risk it. I also developed antibodies (apparently no one does!) but they weren’t at a level that I would’ve needed to stop but for the lip swelling. 

I’m so sad to have to stop entyvio :( it has been great and I’m scared to start something else!"
514,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Crohn's Disease,4,"Extreme fatigue, pain in arms and legs, headaches, constipation. Full time job trying to manage these symptoms, getting worse after 3 years of Entivyo. Crohns is under control, but no energy to live life. Doctor says this is the best choice I have. I’m alive, but not living. I may stop Entivyo and take my chances. Tried supplements, no help."
515,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,1,I’ve had ulcerative colitis for 16 years I just got my first dose of Intivio and 3 days later I had 2 seizures and Dr is denied that Intivio was the reason. Now my brain is foggy and I don’t feel normal. I will now have to go back to mesalamine   Beware and ask your Dr a lot of questions as this drug is really unproven. I know a person that had seizures after first dose of Humira and Dr also denied it had anything to do with Humira   These are similar compounds. Don’t be an experiment
516,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,,"Entyvio has worked wonders for me the entire time I’ve been taking it— I finally feel like my ulcerative colitis is under control and I can finally breathe again for the first time in years without the anxiety or worry of my condition weighing me down. The infusion itself is the most inconvenient part, but the affects of the drug of severe colitis is definitely worth the inconvenience. I love it"
517,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Crohn's Disease,8,"Entyvio wears off a week or two before next infusion. I begin to get flare symptoms. I’m starting a six week infusion schedule. 

Otherwise after being on every conceivable biological, antibiotic, 5-ASA’,steroids and TNF blockers with the exception  of stelara - entivio seems to work well. Unfortunately unlike Stelara, entivio only works on my gut and not other complications from my crohns."
518,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,10,"I was on the clinical trial scheduled for 30 injections, after the second I no longer had symptoms. I was given a third injection per the trial policy. I was then told I would no longer get the injections since it worked for me. I've been in remission since my last injection. I am still taking mesalamine. It has been several months and no symptoms . Thank God."
519,For Crohn's Disease,7,"Started Vedolizamab for Crohn's diease April 2020 in the midst of COVID-19 pandemic, not recommended. Had a reaction as first dose just completed, hot, flushed, hands swelling palms itchy. Was given IV Piriton then ok but sleepy that day. Next day nausea stopped (had it 2.5 years), felt better every day, energized for 10 days then bam, all came back. 2nd dose same reaction 10 mins in, IV Piriton, great for 10 days, then pain, gurgling, D&V, blacked out. Shoulder neck pain bad. 3rd dose not as bad reaction, no Piriton, but also didn't felt as good as doses 1 & 2, feet and legs so swollen, weight increase 9lbs retained fluid, bad gastritis, leg pains, eyes bad. OFG (orofacial granulomatosis) same my mouth ulcers got worse, oral swelling worse. So hope I settle down during 8 weeks before next one. The nausea though not as bad at moment, so that is good. My NHS unit swapped location to enable us to continue with meds during pandemic otherwise I would have been worse I think having to wait months for treatment."
520,For Crohn's Disease,1,"Was in remission when I began entyvio, within 90 days I began to become jaundice, it caused severe problems with my eyesight even having bile drain from tear ducts, massive bile fluid retention, changes in liver function, unexplained abscesses, acute disease progression requiring hospitalizations, corrective surgeries. Since I have discovered new safety guidelines have been released which Takeda pharmaceutical hid, and failed to inform patients or doctors that fistulizing patients are NOT suitable candidates for this drug, and as of Dec 2016, the maker and the FDA have not made this information public as company stock would plummet. 
This drug is extremely dangerous and was fast tracked by the FDA due to the companies financial crisis.."
521,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Crohn's Disease,5,"I have been on Entivyo for 1 year. I get horrible headaches for about a week after infusion.  I have had Crohn's for 35 years, been on every medication and I don't know if I should continue on it. I've had 4 bowel surgeries and my poor body is still in pain and sick everyday. I fight through and try to stay positive but the headaches are really tough. Anyone else have headaches?"
522,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,4,"I have received my first three infusions and my hair is falling out so badly. I have lost at least half my hair. I use to have think beautiful curls. I was so sick before the Entyvio. It’s working but after the third infusion I experienced joint pain that made it difficult to walk, fatigue, aches that felt like the flu was setting in. Symptoms continued for two solid weeks. I just wish my hair would stop falling out. I wake up in the middle of the night thinking about it. I’m 47 and devastated that I am on my way to being bald."
523,For Ulcerative Colitis,10,"10 years pancolitis.  Slipping and sliding with different drugs for years 2 to 8 - one step away from colostomy.  Consultant suggested vedolizumab, it's been amazing, almost full remission for last 2 years, no side effects - long may it last!"
524,For Ulcerative Colitis,1,"I had the worst experience with this medication. My  ulcerative colitis (UC) symptoms improved, however after 48 hours of having the first dose I started to develop flu symptoms. By day 3 after developing symptoms my flu was severe. I had all side effects you could think of, these being: headache, high temperature/fever, loss of appetite, feeling sick, dry heaving (which severely strained my muscles and organs and made it worse trying to eat), sore throat, oral thrush, drowsiness, feeling very weak, weight loss (due to little food intake), sore sinuses, back ache, chills with high temperature, fast heart rate, bad night sweats, sleeplessness, bad cough, ankle aches when lying in bed and sore eyes. It has now been over 3 weeks since I had the first dose and I haven't had another dose since then  yet I am still suffering with a cough and back ache. My temperature still varies and gets high later in the day. From my experience with IBD infusions, all I can say is stay away from them! They do more damage than good!"
525,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Crohn's Disease,10,"Diagnosed with Crohn's and started Entyvio a year and a half ago. My inflammation markers have been trending down this whole time and I am now in remission. This drug works very well for controlling my Crohn's. I did not have any remarkable or lasting side effects from Entyvio until recently. After my 16th infusion I started getting a rash around my eyes, itchy eye lids, and flaking skin. The dry skin patches have now spread to around my ears and mouth. If this side effect can be managed, I will have no issue with this drug."
526,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,1,"Was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis (UC) 3 years ago. Put off entyvio again and again with my doctor but he kept pushing it and I finally gave in after a second hospitalization. I honestly can’t say if it helped my UC much at all. I lasted a little over a year on the infusions but wish I would have stopped it sooner.

Tons of fatigue the day of/after infusions that seemed to steadily build with time into constant extreme fatigue. Hair loss (that hasn’t returned), general autonomic/CNS symptoms - migraines, numbness, worsening insomnia, and aching all over my body. I’d lie in bed at night and feel like my brain was on fire. I’ve been off of it a year and although my doc will deny lasting symptoms from the entyvio, a lot of the neurological symptoms have remained.

Wish I hadn’t given in to my doc and stayed off of it by any means necessary. 

I was supposed to start medical school and likely won’t be able to now. Would highly advise against using it."
527,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Crohn's Disease,4,"Entyvio did help me took almost 2 years but now they won't help with insurance copay, and I cannot take it any more it is way to expensive,  I am really so angry this has happened, I never thought I could not get the meds I need"
528,For Crohn's Disease,9,"Very Good Experience with vedolizuma
Started at May 2018
and so far (OCT 2019) working fine. My Inflammation markers have dropped and I'm in the normal range. I really hope this drug continues to work for me for a long time. Do get some side effects such as mild joint main and congestion but rather get those than get freaking infections from Remicade and Humira which both only worked for a little bit. Was about to get surgery but this worked out and if this fails I've got a lot of other options.My Crohn's is Mild - Moderate"
529,For Ulcerative Colitis,9,"I was severely ill from my diagnosis of ulcerative colitis, had been hospitalised 3 times in 4 months and the Drs were at a loss as to what to do.  Infliximab failed and I was on the operating list as a last resort. Then after a bowel infection, they tried Vedoolizumab and a year on I am doing well and almost have my life back!! Can’t believe the difference it’s made. Shame I didn’t have this first as could’ve avoided prolonged agony and wouldn’t have lost a year of my life trying to get to this point."
530,For Ulcerative Colitis,9,"I have had UC for about eight years and have been on Entyvio the past five years. I was originally on Apriso, which worked well for about a year. Budesonide was added and it made a big difference but since it's a steroid I was unable to take it indefinitely. So I started on Entyvio in the fall of 2015 and have been happy with the results. Early on, I dealt with joint pain and fatigue after my infusions. The joint pain stopped, and I feel fatigued for maybe a day afterward. The one difficulty I have is the severity of colds I get. They seem to last 3-4 weeks, I feel terrible and the stuff I cough up and blow out of my nose is beyond belief. I have allergies so a cold would typically cause problems for me but not like what I experience now."
531,For Ulcerative Colitis,6,"The good:
It worked incredibly well for me when I used it every four months.

The bad:
Now I don't know if this is linked to the drug for sure...but a few months after taking the drug my blood tests started coming back abnormal. Later in the year I was diagnosed with PSC (Primary sclerosing cholangitis ) a form of liver disease. Likewise there are lots of horrible side effects like sore throat, fatigue, increased joint pains, etc. Due to the weakened immune system I also got a bunch of infections, especially in hair follicles which caused severe itchiness. I also got a heart infection (pericarditis), two lots of pneumonia and an opportunistic lung infection that forced me to permanently cease use of the drug. My consultant told me if I remained on it I would die. So all of these infections are all pretty serious and life threatening. Only take this drug if you are desperate and have no other options. Bear in mind as good as the drug can be for treating the bowel, the drug could cost you your life."
532,For Crohn's Disease,1,"I've had Crohn's for 20 years now- worst area is the Terminal Ileum & after no response to any other therapies, I finally had to have surgery & a temporary Illeostomy that was reversed this year.  I've had 2 treatments of Entyvio so far but I'm already contemplating stopping it or pulling out of the drug trial I'm in.  The pain is excruciating, I feel like there's a pinched nerve in my shoulders (alternating between L & R randomly), my back kills, my head kills, my joints are stiff & hurt like a Mack truck hit me.  I feel overwhelmingly fatigued all day every day but can't sleep (even with sleeping aids).  And ironically I have more abdominal pain now and even less of an appetite than I did before.  My gut *pun intended* is saying this drug is not for me.  But I'm crushed because my last colonoscopy already showed disease activity 6 months post op.  This drug trial was really my last option and I don't know what to do  :("
533,"For Crohn's Disease, Maintenance",5,"Started Vedolizumab in December 2021 had two infusions and then started using the entyvio pen every two weeks started to get huge injection site reactions where my leg swelled up and was super itchy, hard as a rock and hot so was switched back to the infusions. Since this last infusion about 10 days ago I feel so tired and sleepy, have nausea every day and feel dizzy and eyes are sensitive to the daylight, don't have headaches or that but feel like a weird sensation throughout my body plus have a lot of joint pain, I feel like I'm going crazy and people think I'm a hypochondriac :( gonna see if I can change to something else because this feeling is awful was getting flares every couple of months but I dunno which is worse anyone else feeling this ?"
534,For Crohn's Disease,1,"I had my 2nd loading dose. It floored me, constant nausea, a weird popping sensation in my brain.  Severe muscle aches and spasms. A year later I am still the same no better. That stuff has  ruined my life. I'm now waiting in a pandemic (have no clue when I will get seen) to see a neurologist. I saw a rheumatologist and have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia which consultant has said due to vedolizumab. Many people have success. This has ruined my life."
535,For Crohn's Disease,10,"I have been on vedolizumab for 5 months. It has certainly helped me. No more pain, no more rushing to the loo all the time, not daring to go out in case of accidents. The infusions take about 2 hours and haven't caused any side effects as yet. I was very reluctant to start vedolizumab as the brochure they give you about it goes into detail about the side effects, but in the end I was strongly advised by my gastroenterologist to take it , so I stopped arguing and did, now I am so pleased that I did."
536,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,9,"Had serum sickness on Remicaide due to extended gap in treatment, after failed treatment to conventional therapy. Rash and fever to Humira.
I did very well on SYMPHONI. But....insurance refused to pay for the monthly injections (Medicare/supplement) 3  doses in. So I had  fatigue, hot flashes, minimal joint pain. Good results so far. I don't like going to office for infusions when self injection was going well.
Company that produces this drug refused financial assistance. I retired from nursing after 46y in hospital setting.
X"
537,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Crohn's Disease,9,Been on this for just under a year now and seems to be doing the trick.  Cimzia was no longer working and that was after remicade and humira.  Running out of options it seems but luckily this drug seems to be working well.
538,For Ulcerative Colitis,7,"I have UC effecting my rectum and sigmoid. I have been flaring since last Christmas went on prednisolone, tacrolimis suppositories, foam enemas, pred suppositories with little effect.  I then started to react to prednisolone so tapered down as quickly as possible. I had a reaction to azathioprine so no go there.

I've had months of budesonide MMX which worked until September then stopped despite taking foam enemas and suppositories.  

I started vedolizomab 2 weeks ago and already I've halved the amount of times I go to the toilet, now able to sleep through and hardly any bleeding. So far this is my magic cure!  I've just had my second dose today.  I just feel sleep in the evening of the infusion, get leg cramps for a day or two and that's about it. Keeping my fingers crossed"
539,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Crohn's Disease,4,"I have been receiving Entyvio infusions for about three years for a Crohn's diagnosis of 40 plus years.
I generally feel good but am plagued by frequent bowel movements - two to five time per day. Keeping a normal weight for my height is a challenge as it is a daily struggle to eat enough to replace nutrients lost during my daily purging. My current colonoscopies show that inflammation in my small intestine is 'stable' meaning it hasn't improved or gotten worse. When I first went on Entyvio I was told my Crohn's was in remission. Now I'm questioning whether Entyvio has run its course and time to try another treatment. I would rate the effectiveness of Entyvio at about a 4. If the number of bowel movements were to improve I would rate it close to and 8 or 9."
540,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Crohn's Disease,10,"I’ve had Crohn’s since 1968.  I’ve been on asulfadine, prednisone, Bentyl, amitripaline, parnate, remicade.  Prednisone worked but the side effects impacted my joints.  Second surgery in 2006.  Started Imuran.  It worked ok but not great.  At my age, the doc said lymphoma potential was becoming a possibility.  So I started Entyvio.  It’s been over two years.  I have my life with no issues except getting the infusion every 8 weeks.  No side effects.  Colonoscopy after 2 years showed over 90% reduction in inflammation.  Biggest issue is losing 2 feet at the end of the small intestine resulted in needing B-12, D, E, K, and iron.  BMS down to two a day unless I have certain spices or fatty meat, or anything deep fried.
No medicine works for everyone, but this one has worked for me."
541,For Ulcerative Colitis,8,"I have been on Entyvio for about a year and a half. It has been wonderful, as long as I follow my diet. I think it’s great. I had a colonoscopy April 30 and the results were the best that I ever had, so the drug is doing something and it’s great."
542,For Ulcerative Colitis,6,"Started this drug vedolizumab in June 2020 after being hospitalised due to bad flare up of Ulcrative Colitis. Was put on 40mg pred and had first vedolizumab infusion.
Came off steroids in August 20 and have been steroid free. My symptoms have improved a lot, I just get abdominal pains which I can manage. However the side effects on vedolizumab have been pretty bad, at first I had really bad join pains especially in my ankles/wrist and back, then the fatigue was really bad, still feel very tired, I have good days and bad ones. Also get random attacks of cold and runny nose. I also get strange chest tightness, had CT and x ray all fine so can only assume side effect of vedolizumab.

Although vedolizumab has helped my UC a lot, the side effects have been pretty awful. I'm just doing my best to stick it out in the hope that the side effects will wear off with time. 

My advice give it a try if nothing else has worked."
543,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,1,"I had really thick hair, I started Entyvio, and it made my hair shed so much that I lost probably 30% of my hair. I wasn't too concerned about it at first because I used to have to get my hair thinned because I had so much hair. I stopped Entyvio 3 months ago and my hair is still thinner than it used to be and I am still shedding probably more than the average person but not nearly as bad as when I was on it. I could put my hands through my hair and see so much falling out. Entyvio stays in your system for at least a month after your last dose so I'm hoping my hair will become healthier again. I'm on Humira now so hopefully it doesn't cause it too but it's gotten MUCH BETTER being on Humira. Also Entyvio didn't work for me for UC, it only has a 40% success rate. I was on it for 6 months."
544,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,10,30 years of ulcerative colitis. After just 2 months I was symptom free and last colonoscopy I was told my colon was fine. Gave me my life back.
545,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,4,5 doses of Entyvio...the exhaustion has completely wrecked my life. Seeing some improvement but not enough to continue with the medication.
546,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,10,"Entyvio has been miraculous. Very close to getting my colon taken out, we decided to try Entyvio. After using Remicade, Humira and many other options, it's the only thing that's worked for me."
547,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Crohn's Disease,1,My husband took this drug a couple years ago for Crohn's and it caused him to have a stroke. He is lucky to be alive but would never recommend this drug to anyone.
548,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,5,"Entyvio works but it wears off after 3 weeks. It is 8 weeks between the IVs.
By 5 weeks, I am back to passing mush and having accidents. This is not acceptable for a $40K drug."
549,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,1,I stopped seeing positive results after the loading doses and noticed an increase in symptoms after each subsequent infusion.
550,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Crohn's Disease,10,"I was nervous to try something other than Remicade, but since the antibodies for Remicade were increasing I had to try something.  This drug has been a good substitute with no noticeable side effects."
551,"Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Crohn's Disease, Maintenance",1,Side effects of Enyyvio is extreme fatigue. Will not get another one.
552,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,8,Entyvio has been life changing for me. I have been dealing with UC for 18 years. Entyvio has worked better than any other treatments I have tried and I have had no side effects.
553,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Crohn's Disease,1,"Flushing similar to hot flashes, nausea, severe headaches/migraines, increased diarrhea the day of infusion for up to two weeks after."
554,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,1,It worked for a year.  Now I'm worse
555,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,2,"Very bad side effects and no remission, it makes me very tired and  have a fever every 2 weeks"
556,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,9,"On this for 6 months now, and I've been in remission for the last 3 months."
557,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Crohn's Disease,4,"bowel control increased to approximately 60%

side effects: runny nose, increased mucus, cough"
558,Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Crohn's Disease,3,"Stayed on it for over a year. Took in combination with Entocort. Saw little to no improvement. Gave significant side effects such as flushing, fevers, nausea, chills, severe migraines etc."
559,"Entyvio (vedolizumab) for Crohn's Disease, Maintenance",8,Low back pain.
560,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Crohn's Disease,9,"I had crohn's for 30 years been on loads different treatment, loads hospital stays  but after 4th injection my stomach is now great!!   No joint muscle pain more energy. Walk my dog miles everyday over forest .. it’s miracle !!.. so happy "
561,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Crohn's Disease,8,"I am going into my 8th week post my initial IV infusion on Stelara and so far so good. I recently got diagnosed with small bowel fistulizing Crohns and my GI doctor and I decided that Stelara would be the best treatment option for me before trying any other option.  I experienced a decrease in abdominal cramping immediately after the initial treatment but the other symptoms persisted. At the 6 week mark all my Crohns symptoms decreased significantly. My appetite is back and I am putting on some weight, and I am having normal bowel movements. My chronic eye inflammation has also significantly decreased which makes me suspect that it is indeed Crohns related. I am only in the beginning stages of treatment but the impressive results makes me so hopeful and honestly has made me forget that I had Crohn's to begin with. No negative side effects so far but I did notice it has taken me way longer to get over a cold,  but nothing other than that. Praying that this continues to work for me!"
562,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,8,"46 year old male.  Not to be overly dramatic, but I was ready to commit suicide my skin was so bad.  My hands looked like I was a fire victim.  My elbows and legs burned and bled constantly.  My scalp would flake and drop into my eyes and all over my clothes.  I was in constant pain, and my relationships were non existent.  Flaky skin would drift off of me whatever I did.  I was weeks away from having to leave work and go on disability, which would have been the end of the line for me.  Depression set in so badly I just wanted to end it all.  Then I found a new dermatologist.  Everything changed.  My first shot of Stelara made a difference.  Nine months later, 90% clear.  A few trouble spots, but my hands are CLEAR!  What a life changer!"
563,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Crohn's Disease,10,"Amazing drug that has put my Crohn's into remission!
Humira, Remicade, Cimzia, Entyvio, 6mp, Lialda, all failed to work for any period of time. I have Fistulizing Crohn's and had 3 feet of resection 2 years ago. Two years on Stelara and I have my life back. I also changed my diet to the Mediteranean, avoiding simple sugars and eating only healthy food. Changing the gut microbiome along with finding the right medicine is key to controlling Crohn's. Much research now is pointing to the role of healthy gut microbiota. Stelara is so simple to inject with it's tiny syringe! Lower risk of serious side effects than other medicines in it's class! Amazing!"
564,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Crohn's Disease,8,"I'm a Crohns survivor for 44 yrs. Tried all the old meds some new. Remicade worked best for 3 yrs and 6 MP for 4 yrs. Humira worked for 9 yrs but all symptoms returned. Stelara was my golden hope. First 8 months..nothing!
Now one year after initial IV infusion...much better results...almost too good. Constipation is my norm. Painful gas constantly...bloating..exhaustion...and a simple head cold took forever to leave.
Not sure I will continue this. Body aches and joint pain much worse. My main issues are constipation and exhaustion.
I'd rather have diarrhea and a bit more energy. Very disappointed! Good luck Crohnies!!"
565,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Crohn's Disease,8,"I was diagnosed with Crohn's Disease in 1995, although I have been fighting with a bad stomach much longer.
I have had 4 feet of my intestines removed through 4 different resections. ( usually 1 every 5 years.) I have been on Cimzia, Humira, steroids and lialda. I started Stelara in the summer of 2017, It stopped me from throwing up almost every time I ate, I still get cramping, but not nearly as painful as I did before.  I am putting on some weight, thanks to some help. I remain hopeful that Stelara will continue to help me fight this crappy disease. I hope it helps all who take it, until a cure can be found.  Love"
566,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Crohn's Disease,10,"I have Crohn's Disease and tried three different medications and broke out with Psoriasis from head to toe.  Lost my hair and the ability to walk faster than a snail because my feet swelled up.  Since Stelara, I have lost over 60 lbs, Psoriasis completely cleared, hair growing back.  I exercise at least 3-4 times a week and feel wonderful.  I think Stelara helped my digestive system and now everything is working.  Biggest problem with Stelara is, now I have to get a new wardrobe."
567,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,10,"All I can say is this drug has been a life saver. If you are reading this, you’ve probably already tried other medications by now. For me, initially I tried Remacaid. After a few infusions, no success. Then I tried Entyvio. Same result. Getting very discouraged, I now tried Xeljanz. No improvement at all. This was all over a year and a half. I was starting to come to the realization that surgery was my only option. Then my Gastroenterolgist suggested Stelara which although known to be treated for rheumatoid arthritis, recent studies have shown success with ulcerative colitis. After my first treatment, I started seeing my symptoms improving. After my second treatment I was seeing drastic changes to point where my bowel movements were down to 2-3x per day, down from 10-15. Today, I can proudly say I am in remission and am leading a normal life, back to a regular diet and normal bowel movements. I can honestly say I owe my life to this drug and am thankful every day for it."
568,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,6,"On Stelara for about 9 months now.  It does work well on reducing my very thick, very stubborn head to toe psoriasis that I've suffered from for nearly 20 years.

The reason I am only giving it a 6 rating is that the manufacturer has totally over rated their product in terms of the length of time it lasts.  For me, this medicine lasts about 4 weeks at best and I need another shot or the psoriasis flares up with the vengeance of a woman scorned.  If I was to wait the suggested 12 weeks the psoriasis becomes worse than before I started.  As a result of this, the price of the medicine should be drastically reduced to better reflect it's true half-life."
569,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Crohn's Disease,,Been on Stelara for a year now. Have seen relief of symptoms but meds do not stay in my body. We are now dosing every 4 weeks starting this month.  I’m concerned about the long term effects of taking this medicine. Over these past 6 years I have been on 5 different biologics and none have helped me so far.
570,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Crohn's Disease,9,"I was diagnosed with Ulerative Colitis in 2006, but did not start biologics until 2017-2018. Started with Humira and found that I was a nonresponder.  For the rest of 2018, and into 2019, I tried other meds and battled with my insurance on which medicine is covered based on their formulas. During those times I was not responding to anything, developed fistulas, and was found to have my UC progress to Crohn’s (or I may have had Crohn’s all along). I started taking Stelara and I feel great. My symptoms have improved to where I don’t think about them. I have my life back. I do take longer to get over respiratory infections and do have some joint pain, but I did also before Stelara so nothing new there. The one side effect I noticed is ringing in the ears sometimes. Stelara has changed my life."
571,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Crohn's Disease,9,"I am 55 and was officially diagnosed with Crohn’s about 10 years ago after many tests and misdiagnoses.  I am convinced I’ve had it for probably 20 years. I tried Humira, Entivio and Stelara. The first two caused significant joint pain and brought no improvement to my Crohn’s. I started Stelara 10 months ago and am now in remission for the first time since my diagnosis.  No significant side effects other than some fatigue the day of and day after the injection. Very happy with this medication. Easy to use and only once every 8 weeks. Good luck to all those searching for their own ‘right’  medication. Stick with it and don’t lose hope!"
572,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Crohn's Disease,8,"After 41 yrs of Crohn's & being non responsive to all treatments, including biologics, I've been on Stelara now for 16 weeks, & I'm starting to see a real difference !! I was reluctant to believe that it would work but, I'm ecstatic that something may actually turn things around for me. Best yet, NO Side Effects !! "
573,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Crohn's Disease,8,"Stelara's been a great for me. I'm 64, have had Crohn's for 50 years and undiagnosed for 20 years until my mid-30's. I'm now in the best shape I've been in decades--no cramping pain for 3 years since starting injections. Been biking 30 miles a week, playing flag football and basketball, working with weights and a trainer 3x weekly. No side effects--yay!"
574,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,10,"Absolute miracle drug.  You wont believe it until you've tried.I have been head to toe covered in Guttate and plaque Psoriasis since age 19. By age 28, I have explored everything thinking 'Oh, this helped a bit'..'Let's try X,y,z'....' With Stelara, its not like that. Three injections in, it felt like Psoriasis never happened. Its very odd. Even creams used to leave a sticky sensation, hardening or thickening or white rings on the skin. With Stelara, NOTHING. No side effects - no even small bother. I just cracked on with life feeling very lucky that my 15 year nightmare, poof, vanished. Sufferers forget, that actually without Psoriasis, you're skin is beautiful and radiant down there."
575,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Crohn's Disease,7,"4 weeks after my initial loading dose my Crohn's is already much better, however the fatigue it is almost too much to bear. Despite having Crohn's disease I can usually get through the day and be productive. But on this drug I don't want to get out of bed. "
576,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Crohn's Disease,,"I am worse on Stelera then I have ever been, I'm on it for Crohn's.
Been hospitalized more now then before!!!
I have had something going on in my stomach since I was 10 years old.
 I've been embarrassed, ashamed, frustrated, and exhausted. 
I am 55 years old.
I have had 2 surgery's which I am blessed cause I know there are many that have many more. A million colonoscopys. 
So Many perceptions.
All I want is some normalcy in my Life.
I've used three doses so far... Done with it!!!"
577,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,10,"My Psoriasis started in my sophomore year in college (1985). Every year, my condition has gotten progressively worse. I've tried everything from PUVA, steroids, coal tar, Methotrexate, Enbrel, Humira & more.  I've had success with the biologics, but got very ill with sinus infections on both Enbrel and Humira (so bad that I got vertigo and had to go to hospital via ambulance). I took 2 years off and now just started Stelara (had my ""booster"" second shot yesterday).  My dermatologist is shocked how I've cleared already!  This is a miracle and any person out there who can take it, should.  I'm also sleeping so much better during the night-- not scratching in my sleep!  Good luck and hopefully one day, we'll have a cure for this dreadful disease."
578,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,10,"I am 61 and first contracted psoriasis when I was 46 years old. It started on my elbows and gradually spread to my arms, torso, buttocks and legs. The last few years have been extremely difficult with a lot of redness and flaking. I could not wear short pants or short sleeves as I was very embarrassed. Over the years I tried hundreds of over the counter creams, supplements, light treatments, saunas, baths, diets, and prescription steroid creams and ointments. Nothing worked...until Stelara. Three weeks after my first shot of Stelara I was 95% clear. Two weeks after the second shot a month later I was completely clear of psoriasis."
579,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Crohn's Disease,,Stelara has worked fantastically for me where Humira was a failure.  I found that the biweekly Humira shots were not enough to control symptoms but the initial 8 week infusion of Stelara has been great.
580,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Crohn's Disease,5,"Stelara was effective in the sense that it quickly healed my colon that had Crohn's disease. I would be thrilled except that after a few doses I developed horrible anxiety/depression, tinnitus and headaches. I have been on other biologics without these issues. I did not feel like myself anymore, so I chose to stop it because the negative outweighed the positive. Everyone responds differently."
581,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,9,"I have used Stelara now for 8 months. After years of anguish, defeat, pain( physically and mentally) sadness, I feel freed from this terrible curse. My skin/joints looks but mainly FEELS so much better. My quality of life has sky rocketed! Your initial ground work obtaining Doctor appointments, TB testing and establishing the right dosage that is effective for you and receiving assistance helping with cost. Once you get through those things... I guarantee it IS worth it!! DO IT!"
582,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,5,"I have had psoriasis since I was 4. Been on everything from biologics to light therapy. Stelara cleared me up but not without a price. I m a very healthy,exercise minded individual. Since being on, my blood sugar is off, I have night sweats, swollen breasts, feet, hands, swollen tonsils, and tiredness. My vitamin d levels are also low. Went of stelara for 6 months and every side effect went away. Flared up and went on it again and all symptoms came back!"
583,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,9,"I have had chronic Psoriasis for 25 years, since I was 9, all over my body, face and hands.  I tried Methotrexate when I was 22, and I was finally clear for the first time. 

I was on this medication for 12 years, with a small break to have my child. Unfortunately it just stopped working, my liver wasn't happy and my Psoriasis was coming back, BAD.

My only option was biologic therapy - Humira or Stelara. I had to undergo months of tests to qualify for funding. 

I finally had my first injection 7 weeks ago, and without exaggeration on the second day I felt my skin changing, relaxing. A week in and it had visably got better, thinner and less angry.
Now my skin is 90% clear, just some slight pinkness on my legs. And no side effects!
AMAZING!"
584,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Crohn's Disease,5,"Just started stelara,  I can tell I'm very tired and it gives me a little tummy pain and sore throat. I'm bloated but always have been on and off.  Harder stools at times constipated.  I've had 3 bowel rejections and now have 2 fistulas I'm praying I can get rid of my second  1 being on stelera. I'm still having a few flare ups with fistulas but hope I will work yet just started. I'm going to ear nose and throat doctor tomorrow  I've had ear pain inner ear and headaches and not sure if any is related to stelara it started at same time and hurts more a bit now but just had an injection 2.5 weeks ago.  I'll keep everyone posted! HAS anyone noticed eating issues or headaches sore throat and coughing up a little phlegm?"
585,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,10,"I got diagnosed with psoriasis about three years ago, it wasn't bad at first so I never paid too much attention to it, and it eventually went away. About a year ago it came back, and took over my entire body. I was covered in rough, itchy, red patches and there was nothing that would fix it. I tried natural oils, salts, tanning, ointments, foams, even pills, and nothing worked. These things helped and soothed my psoriasis, but nothing really made it go away. I finally turned to Stelara and I could cry from the results. I am getting my second injection this Friday, and after only the FIRST one, my skin looks 75% better. The injection immediately caused my skin to be less itchy, and appear far less irritated. I suggest Stelara to EVERYONE!!!"
586,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,10,"Using Stelara has been nothing short or amazing for me. I didn't have 95% body-coverage like some of the people here but my hands were completely covered and it seemed to be spreading onto my wrists and up my forearms. The pain was excruciating and I was emotionally exhausted from constantly trying to hide what was happening to me. I'm a musician/educator and spend a great deal of time in front of people.  I do feel that Stelara saved my life. I am 100% clear of all signs of psoriasis. No itch, no bleeding, no pain, just normal looking skin. I am also completely alleviated from the mental strain, anxiety, self-consciousness, etc. What an amazing change in my life."
587,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,10,"I had psoriasis on about 85% of my body before I started on the Stelara.  I have used virtually all the immunosuppressant medications in the past: Enbrel, Raptiva, Humira, just to name a few.  They all did well for a few months, but always ended up not working.  Even when they were working, I always had patches on my legs and scalp that wouldn't go away.  Not with Stelara.  A week after my first injection, the flakiness was gone, with the red quickly fading to pink.  A month later, I had my second and within 2 weeks all spots were gone.  I have now been on the medication for over a year and am currently completely free of any plague, no redness, no maddening itch.  I go and have an injection every 3 months.  Best medicine ever."
588,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Crohn's Disease,,"I have recently had my second bowel resection for Crohn's and today have started my first infusion of Stelara.  No other drug has helped unfortunately.  Chronic constipation, bloating and an inability to digest or process food has left me not really eating at all for the past 2 years.  I am hopefully this drug will give me a quality of life again but am also aware the side effects may become an issue.  The depression side of things may be interesting as I am bipolar...hopefully I'm covered there..Good luck to us all on our journey."
589,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,10,"I have suffered from psoriasis for 20yrs and the condition fluctuated over this time. I have tried creams, methotrexate, light therapy and cyclosporine - none of which helped. Eventually I saw a fantastic dermatologist -  I had to try 3 treatments and if they failed, I could apply for permission to try biologics. I tried Enbrel first -worked until I fell ill with tonsilitis & my psoriasis came back with a vengence. I switched to Stelara, I am about to take my 5th injection, and it has been amazing. Within weeks, I was almost clear. This was the 1st summer I've been happy to show my body at the beach! Minimal side effects too."
590,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,9,"Now 48, I have had psoriasis for 32 years. Never have I experienced a medication that has worked so well. I have been covered head to toe and I am now 95% clear. So nice to not see psoriasis in the mirror. I wish everybody can have results like mine."
591,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,,"Psoriasis cleared completely after first injection, now 6 weeks after my second one its starting to come back on my head, I'm also experiencing difficulties deep breathing while exercising and when I exert myself, also elbow and knee pain, being an active exercise person this is dramatically affecting me now,"
592,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,10,"I had 65% coverage of my body with thick plaque psoriasis. PUVA, methaltrexate, every cream in the book....no improvement. Was fortunate enough to join the clinical trials for stelara in 2005, have been injecting 90 mg every 3 months since then.  I am 99.9% clear with no flare ups and PA under control. No side effects that I can recognize. To me Stelara is a life changer."
593,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,10,"Stelara is a life saver.  I have psoriasis for over 30 years. I have tried creams, PUVA, Vit A meds, Fumiderm, Otezla nothing has worked. My last med Otezla didn't work for me and made things much worse. I had my first Stelara injection on May 7 2016. After about 10 days I could feel an improvement. After 4 weeks there was a dramatic improvement and I was almost clear.  It is 9 weeks since my second injection and my life has changed in so many ways for the better thanks to this medicine.  There is a slight redness where some of the patches were but the dermatologist assures me these will fade. I have no side affects whatsoever. Thank you for this life changing medicine and for restoring my self esteem after all this time"
594,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,8,"I had almost disabling psoriasis for 10 years.  My feet was my biggest problem area, many flare ups made it hard to even walk.  I too have been on everything in the past, starting with ointments all the way to Remicade, Humira, and Enbrel with little success, mostly only helped for less than 6 months.  Prednisone has almost ruined my joints, and as most of you know causes weight gain.  In September 2012 I got my first injection.  By December I was completely clear doing insanity workouts!  Over 2 years I enjoyed a psoriasis free life and it's been great!  Unfortunately, I started flaring 2 months ago, and my dermatologist put me back on prednisone as my whole body is covered again.  Not sure where to go from here."
595,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,9,"I have had servere psoriasis for 15 years I am now 34 nothing has work apart from u v but the condition soon came back after treatment since being on stelara I have notice a 90% improvement before starting I was 80% covered I could not hardly walk I had thick scales from my neck right down to my ankles since I have been on stelara all I have is a long thin white patch on the inside of my right leg and and I still have some red on both sides of my stomic,i have never felt so healthy or happy blood test always come back clear and I can at last wear shorts and tops with no sleeves with out worrying about what people think"
596,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,10,"I got my first injection almost 4 weeks ago and am amazed! I've suffered since I was 29 and am now 41. I've tried every topical cream/ointment that's out there. Cortisone injections in my hands and feet that thinned my skin out so bad you can see all my veins - even spent almost $10,000 on an in home phototherapy bed with only sporadic relief. I live at the beach during the summer with my kids and this summer I had to wear a dress to my ankles to save embarrassment.
After only 4 weeks, my feet are 100% clear except for some redness and my legs are clear with the exception of light pink spots where all of my lesions were. No side effects at all so far. I've never been so happy :)"
597,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Crohn's Disease,10,"Stelara put my severe Crohn’s disease into remission and it has stayed that way for the past 6 months. The shots don’t hurt very bad and it’s only 1 every 8 weeks for me! Side effects I’ve noticed: headaches, fatigue, groggy day after shot."
598,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,9,"I developed a severe case of psoriasis soon after my 18th birthday, with 90% of my body covered. For years I tried everything under the sun including steroids, PUVA, all topicals, Embrel, Humira, and methotrexate. The only thing that ever helped was the metho and if I tried to go off of it, I would be unable to leave the house for months on end, living in excruciating pain. I had been on metho for over 30 years, resigned to a life of weekly nausea and chronic lethargy, when my new doctor suggested Stelara. I tried it, positive that it would fail like everything else I had tried. And that was when life began for me again. I have now been on it for 1.5 years and for the most part completely clear. It has been a miracle for me!"
599,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,9,"I am 65. I have had psoriasis and arthritis since I was 13. I was covered. Like others I had used tar, creams, PUVA , UVB in my home and ENBREL which caused many side effects. 
Dreaded white flakes everywhere! Itching was just awful. 2 1/2 years ago I tried Stelara, what a wonder I cleared in 2 injections. What a joy to have clear skin and go in public and not be embarrassed. Had to stop because Medicare did not cover it. I became totally covered again worse then ever. Finally found some finical help. I have had 2 injections, all plaque is gone looks so good. I have  a great deal of redness but expect it to clear. I have had a madding itch the past few days, hope it is not a side effect. "
600,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,10,"Stelara has been great. I have experienced no side effects and I just got my second shot and my Psoriasis is 90% faded after 4 weeks since my first shot.

Basically if your insurance will cover it's realistically a miracle. Good luck reader. I hope you have a similar experience of success."
601,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,10,When I started on Stelara I was covered from head to toe. I’ve been in it now for 4 years and I have no psoriasis! No side effects! I have a pixie hair cut now for the first time! It’s changed my life!
602,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Crohn's Disease,3,"I've been on Stelara for Crohn's for over 10 weeks with poor results. I am losing the remission created by remicade. Stelera caused me exhaustion and I have stomach aches, sensitivity and bowel struggles."
603,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Crohn's Disease,4,"I am on week 2 on the initial Stelara IV infusion. So far, no side affects! (As I had with Humira, Cimzia, and Remicade). I have noticed that I am able to tolerate milk a bit more than I was able to prior. Not as much gas or abdominal cramping. Looking forward, and hoping the medicine will help me achieve remission!"
604,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,10,I have had severe Plaque Psoriasis for 32 years. I am a 50 year old male. I have tried everything you can imagine over all those years. Even a 6 week program at The University of Michigan did not help the 85% coverage I have had since I was 18. Nothing worked until July of 2016 I had my firat Stelara injection. Within 3 months I was almost clear and almost a year later I am clear except for a couple spots under my fingernails.  It is a miracle to me. If you have lived with it you know what I mean.
605,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,10,"I've been on Humira and Enbrel. Hands down those two were the worse experiences of my life. So many side effects. I've tried Methroxate and that was even worse!! Finally, I was introduced to Stelara and I haven't had a flare up for two years now. I work out 5 days a week (weight lifting and cardio) and just have the normal muscle soreness. My joints haven't gotten worse at all. My psoriasis is pretty much all gone. I've had no side effects that I can remember. I haven't gained or lost weight. Long term, not sure how this will affect me but I want the quality of life now and I got it with this shot. most insurances will have you paying $200 but if you get the Stelara card, it goes to a $5 per shot copay! (every three months)."
606,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,10,54 years old ..chronic psoriasis for over 49 years. I've had all the treatments known and then some. This medicine is a God send. It's the only treatment that's ever truly worked and I can say I'm 100%. 
607,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,9,"Stelara is an excellent medication.  I first contracted psoriasis through strep throat.  I  was covered in red spots from the neck down. Previously, I used a medication that cleared it up but it was harsh and made my hair fall out! I switched to Stelara and it cleared it up within days, I kid you not.  The only side effect has been fatigue and maybe a mild case of depression (which I'm not sure can be attributed to the Stelara).  

I'm only giving it a 9 because it won't clear up the patches on my face AND it is very expensive (right now the cost is 19,000 but Johnson & Johnson is covering it).   Highly recommend though."
608,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,9,"I have had severe psoriasis for 22 years. Last year I developed psoriatic arthritis too. The pain was debilitating and made dealing with my skin even harder. It took doctors 6 mth  to prescribe Stelara but once I got it, I got my life back. I've only had 2 jabs but I feel fantastic and my skin us 100% improved. A wonder drug for me. I pray to God it doesn't fail like Humira and Cosentyx. Good luck to all of you suffering with these horrific disease's"
609,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Crohn's Disease,6,I just started Stelara to treat Crohns.  It's been a rough year with 4 hospitalizations and constant illness related to the disease.  I'm so hopeful that Stelara will allow me to stay off the oral steroids.  The steroids are super effective but of course horrible side effects.  I've gained so much weight I don't recognize myself.  I've only been on Stelara a week so too soon to tell but I do notice I'm sleeping a lot more than usual and I've been noticing a slight soreness in my throat.  As I've been reading the reviews I noticed a lot of people mention depression which is concerning as I struggle with depression anyway.  I'm hopeful Stelara may be the drug that finally works for me.    Good luck to everyone in your healing journey.
610,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,10,"I've been battling severe scalp psoriasis for 6 years, as well as the beginning of psoriasis in my genital region. Topicals didn't come close to helping. I was on Otezla for 3 months but the side effects (vomiting, diarrhea, and headaches) were horrible. I tried Humira for 5 months but it didn't reduce the plaques enough.
After my first stelara injection, there was a dramatic decrease in my scalp psoriasis, and the few patches on my genital region disappeared completely. After the second injection, my scalp is 80% clear with no itching or burning. 

The injection itself is pain free, the needle is maybe half an inch. I haven't had any side effects either.
Highly recommend, I'm so happy with the results!"
611,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Crohn's Disease,2,"I was diagnosed 20 years ago and had a right hemi colectomy 15 years ago, Humira stopped working for me so I was changed to Stelara 6 months ago.
First couple of doses intermittent headaches and felt tired but kept on them.
Started with water infections, bad constipation resulting in internal bleeding and haemorrhoids, really tired and depressed caused by the constant headaches and joint pain so I'm giving up with them,"
612,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,10,I am 50 years old and have suffered with severe psoriasis for 45 years. I've tried every treatment known to man and the best is Stelara. I was clear by the second injection and no side effects. I did take a study injection years ago and it worked but made every joint and muscle in my body swell and pain. Needless to say I stopped taking the medicine.  I have been taking injections now for 10 years and my blood work is always perfect so there doesn't seem to be any long term effects.
613,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,10,I'm  53.  I've had psoriasis for as long as i can remember.   It has been moderate most of that time.  About a year ago it started getting bad.  My dermatologist tried the new oral medication.  After three months it was still getting worse.  I got to 95 %.  I coulnt sleep from the intense burning and itching.  They decided to put me on Stelara.   Within a week i noticed a huge difference.   I just got my 1 month shot.  My upper body is completely  clear.  I only have a few spots left on my lower legs and feet.  I was actually on Enbrel 8 years ago.  It did work but this Stelara is incredible.   I cant remember when my skin was this clear.  My girlfreind just hought me a bunch of short sleve shirts.  I is totally amazing.
614,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,9,"I am 41, I have had psoriasis since I was 3 and was misdiagnosed from the beginning as anything from warts to cradle cap. I've used Cole tar, all of the lights(including PUVA), steroids, vitamin D, diet, Chinese herbs, acupuncture and methotrexate ( probably more I can't remember). I have never been more clear than I am now. I've had no side effects that I am aware of and couldn't be happier. 
I was afraid of biologics, but I should have embraced them sooner"
615,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,8,"After 6 years on Enbrel, it finally stopped working and I started on Stelara this past July 2013. Excellent results clearing tough, thick-skinned body areas like elbows and knees within 1 to 1.5 months and I'm very pleased. Somewhat perplexing while on Stelara are short cycles of psoriasis turning up and then disappearing from thin-skinned areas like scalp while the bigger problem body areas remain clear. I never had scalp psoriasis while on Enbrel, but I'd still choose Stelara overall for faster, better overall clearing."
616,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,10,"I am a registered nurse and have had psoriasis since I was 12. I am now 56. It was mostly contained to my scalp during the winter months. But I started experiencing psoriatic arthritis which was getting worse in my hands and feet. 
1 month after starting Stelara, I noticed a difference. It has been 9 months and I have no more psoriasis or arthritis pain. 
I did not experience any side effects. I highly recommend this product."
617,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Crohn's Disease,8,"Been on Stelara injections for 12 months. I didn't detect any problems until 5 months ago when I started losing my balance, got a virus in my mIddle ear and headaches and nausea.  Doctor suspects it is connected to Stelara - has anyone else experienced these symptoms.
Anyone else experienced this??"
618,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Crohn's Disease,10,"I started with Humira when my disease was so horrible. I was in the hospital every month for two years and it never worked.  I’ve had 5 surgeries since 2016 and Stelara was a life saver for me. I started Stelara in the beginning of 2019 and I am still not in remission, getting close, but it definitely makes me feel better and I have no side effects. No bleeding, which was a serious problem for me. Maybe tired, but I am always tired!!  Stelara and my awesome GI doctor have saved my life."
619,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,9,"Stelara is a wonder drug! It has cured up to 98% of the psoriasis I have suffered from for 50 years. No side effects (so far) apart from helping with arthritis of the knees. I can recommend this drug, although very expensive, from my personal experience."
620,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,10,"Wow, what can I say, this medicine has changed my life. My head was the worst, completely covered. Had to put oil on it and leave it on most of day or over night. My head would be stiff after 3 days with the build up. After one treatment it was completely gone. So happy now. Was thinking about going on disability but now don't have too."
621,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,10,"After going through the PUVA, topicals, vitamin E, fish oil, dry skin lotions, both tanning under the sun and even meditation. The answer to my psoriasis has finally arrived after 10 years in the form of Stelara. I'm 47 years old, single, workout at the gym 2x a week and mountain bike every weekend. Two weeks after my first shot in June 2012, I saw improvement on my skin: the scales were flatter and I didn't itch as much, and my dry skin didn't seem to be dry as it was. My face and scalp had the most obvious clearing, that my hair stylist asked what shampoo I was using. When I came back for my next injection in July 2012, I was 90 per cent clear! Now I believe I am 100 per cent clear. So far no side effects. Thank you Stelara."
622,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,9,"I was 90% covered. Dermatologist took one look at me and put me on Stelara. Within a week, people started remarking that the plaques along my hairline seemed to be fading. After the booster, all but my scalp and back of thighs had cleared, and both of those were greatly diminished. Within six months, the raised red areas where the plaques had been were clear. At one year, all that's left is minor plaques on my scalp that could be mild dandruff. I have noticed that things like bruises and bug bites seem to take a long time to heal, but given the action of the drug that seems to make sense. My insurance covers the majority of the (expensive!) medication, and there is a program that covers the rest so I have no out of pocket expense on it."
623,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,10,"64 year old Male Chronic Plaque Psoriasis since age 12. Hospitalised many times. Previously tried everything including PUVA, UVB & Tar, Dithranol, Topica Steroids, Topical Calcipitrol , Acetretin, Cyclosporin, Methotrexate, Fumaric Acid Esters, Infliximab (Remicade) and finally now Stelara.
All treatments with the exception of Acetretin and Cyclosporin have been effective to some degree up to full clearance but the relapse time was always short. Was on Remicade for 3.5 years which was very effective but lost its effect over the last 6 months. Have just had my 3rd set of injections (2 at a time) and am as clear as I have ever been in 52 years. Truly life changing. Paid for by NHS!"
624,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,9,"Have been on Stelara for about a year and a half.  When started, I had 50-60% coverage.  It was down to about 10-15% by the time I had my second injection, and down to about 5% by the time I had my third.  It has remained about that level since, but now only consists of flat pinkish spots that barely itch at all and look more like old scars than the scabby, cracked, bleeding mess they were before.

As for the side effects; I seem to be more prone to various infections than before.  I seem to catch colds more easily.  Also, I usually feel some muscle pain and fatigue starting the day after my injection and lasting for a couple of days (easily dealt with by scheduling my appointments on Friday afternoons and taking it easy over the weekend)."
625,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,9,"I've had psoriasis, and some psoriatic arthritis since I was 12, I'm 40 now. I had 95% body coverage, and started taking Stelara as one of the first trial patients in Canada in early 2009...what a difference. No more throbbing knees, and I hover between 5 - 10% coverage now, it was at 0% for a couple of years but I had an injury and gained a bunch of weight, so that is why it's up now (maybe 3 kids doesn't help either ;-). The only issues I have are the price (thankfully it's covered), and the fact that I am more susceptible to colds and flu, and will get sunburn easily if I don't watch out."
626,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,7,"Back when Stelara was first approved for psoriasis, my dermatologist went ahead and put me on it.  I cleared in one shot, took the next 2, and we laid off.  Minor side effects - some swollen tonsils and sinus issues. Fast forward a year and half - went back on it - after my second shot, I spent the next 6 months going through a continual round of sinus infections that required injected antibiotics, and got confirmed influenza A despite being vaccinated.  Tests showed likely my immune system couldn't handle.  "
627,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,10,"I wish I could post a picture. My arms, legs, and torso were covered in guttate and plaque psoriasis, and now I just have a couple small spots of guttate that pop up around my calves/ankles. I wore a short sleeved dress that came just below the knee to go to dinner with my boyfriend for my birthday, and I felt and looked so great. It helps that I've also worked hard to lose 40 lbs.... But I honestly don't know if I would have worked so hard to lose weight if I would still have had to cover up all the time anyway. The best is that I can wear shorts and tank tops in hot weather again!  I know stelara helps people with much bigger problems. But being comfortable in your own skin is definitely important."
628,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,10,"This has been great for me.  I've struggled with psoriasis for 16 years, then this last year I developed psoriatic arthritis too.  I was given Stelara after much struggle with the insurance company.  The 45 mg dose helped and did more for my psoriasis than my arthritis but the 90mg dose has changed everything.  My hand and my feet are almost completely free of psoriasis and my arthritis is nothing like it was this time last year.  Crazy expensive but it has changed my life."
629,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,1,"Do not use Stelara. I wish I hadn't. I have had nothing but stomach/immune system issues since taking Stelara about 1 year ago. It did reduce the psoriasis but at a cost that no one should pay. I have several scans and an endoscopy only to have the gastro intestinal specialist tell me that my issues appear to be related to the Stelara and that my immune system has potentially been compromised indefinitely.
STAY AWAY from all biological drugs, they are not safe in my opinion."
630,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,10,"Stelara completely cleared 90% BSA, including severe palmar plantar pustular psoriasis within 52 days of initiating treatment. Side effects included extreme fatigue lasting approximately 72 hours after each application. Feeling ""sunburned"" was noted for several days after initial fatigue."
631,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,9,28 year old male.. Been on stelara for 2.5 months went from 70% covered to almost 0% it had worked amazingly... Just a question does any pay know how long it takes to start seeing some of the red go away that was in the really bad spots? Thanks all and good luck
632,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,10,I have suffered from severe plaque psoriasis for ten years. I have taken every biologic medicine that is available and Stelara has been by far the BEST. It has totally changed my life the past two years and the GOOD news is my dermatologist said it is not one of the medicines that eventually stops working like the others. If it clears you and you are healthy with no major side effects its possible to live a psoriasis free life for years! The side effects of many biologics were harsh especially Remicade but the last two years on Stelara I have only noticed a bit of fatigue and only one upper respiratory infection.
633,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,4,"Psoriasis diagnosis: I received my first injection the end of December 2009 and I saw an immediate difference within the first two weeks. The second injection was due; however, I was ill with an upper respiratory virus in which my Doctor indicated to wait until it was resolved. I was about 1.5 weeks late with the 2nd injection. I was flared and received the 2nd injection with itching down 50% and cleared approximately 40%. Two weeks after the 2nd injection, I developed moderate arthritis symptoms in my shoulder, right knee and my finger joints. It was time for the 3rd injection after waiting 3 months. I remained at the 40% clearing. I discontinued this medicine due to joint issues and flaring increase by the end of 3rd month."
634,For Crohn's Disease,10,"Wow. I have tried every medication from 6mp methotrexate humira infliximab vedolizumab etc.  all failed in the end and my latest try vedolizumab didn't work at all.
I was in a flare for 8 months my Consultant said the only option left was to remove my colon.  I have never been in so much pain and weight loss.  Then I got a call from the hospital saying the drug company was willing to offer me ustekinumab. It's not licensed in the UK yet for crohns so I wasn't sure.
But omg within 9 days of treatment  I've never felt so good .  I must admit in those 9 days when I never felt anything I thought it wasn't going to work then boom I woke up one day and felt amazing.   If you get offered this amazing drug just give it time and it will work wonders"
635,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,10,"Had psoriasis for 14 years started in palm of my hands which was really bad for 8 years then my legs, past three years spread all over 90%, no sleep, severe itcing at night, skin shred everyday from room to room embarrassed to go any where wore clothing all over even gloves  I have not even visited family I was depressed I had from puva, uv treatment, tar cream endless of cream and ointment all failed , December 4th 2015 had my first shot of stelara I  must say they have saved my life, no more bleeding, no shredding I still have a long way to go but my skin show so much improvement. thank you I feel so much better This is a miracle drug for all of us who suffer from p 

Thank you

Annette"
636,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Ulcerative Colitis,10,"Ok, I have done Remicade, Humira, Imuran, prednisone, etc. Stelara took a few months to work and I had to be moved from every 8 weeks to 6 weeks, but once I moved to 6 weeks. I went into complete remission of my UC and HORRIFIC joint pain. I have currently been in remission and prednisone free for 8 months"
637,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,10,"At the start, after 2 injections, I was 99.5% cured, then the NHS decided to stop my treatment on the retirement of my Dr , in 5 weeks, the Psoriosis returned, worse than it had ever been, after 8 weeks still no treatment forth coming, my whole body was burning red hot & 75% scaley,  had an injection 3 months ago, 99.9% of my body had cleared of Psoriosis in 2 months, I am due my next one next week, the NHS is holding it back again, I am dreading what is going to happen to me & my body if i don't get the next injection."
638,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,8,"I have been on stelara for over 1 year now. Had psoriasis on the palms of my hands and feet very badly. It has worked very well and i only get ocassional little flares now as oposed to not being able to walk. Side effects have been acceptable, noticed I get sick more easily and am prone to migraines when first taking a shot. Overall I would recommend Stelara for someone who is suffering."
639,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Crohn's Disease,2,"No side effects (only fatigue), but not working very well to control Crohn's flare-up.  Don't use this if you have severe active flare, you will not be able to control your disease. I'm switching to anti-tnf."
640,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,9,"This medication just makes me ask the question WHY PEOPLE STILL TAKE METHOTREXATE AND 6-MP FOR PSORIASIS? I've been on this medication for about a year now and it's been a life saver. It took me from 80% body coverage (very thick plaques under all hair follicles, eyebrows would crack and bleed, just horrible) to just having a few little spots within 8 weeks. If your doctor is going give you a TNF blocker, tell him you want Stelara. So much more effective, convenient, and with fewer side effects. It's now classified by my insurance as the same coverage as Enbrel for psoriasis, and is even covered to a greater degree than Humira. In turn, you may be able to get it as a first line biologic if you request it. "
641,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,10,AMAZING!!!!! Stelara saved my life. it worked within my first injection and by the next month I was 90% clear. I just got my 12 weeks follow up and im 100% clear still taking my injection but clear I was covered head to toe 3 months ago.
642,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Crohn's Disease,9,Stelara was a 1 star for the first 24 weeks. The waiting period was ridiculous. I just did my third at home injection so today puts my 32 weeks in I did not see any results until about 24 weeks on the medication. Stelara works  for crohn's you just have to give it time to work. Now we are starting to work on the dosing schedule to prevent flare ups around dosage time.
643,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,10,"I got my first Plaque psoriasis patch on my scalp in year 2000. Slowly it increased all over the scalp and then different parts of the body. I was controlling it by applying various steroid creams, lotions and moisturizers, but slowly got immune to most of them and not giving any relief. My doctor prescribed my few different drugs one after another. All of them were giving me too much trouble due to adverse side effects. Finally he prescribed me Stelara. I took first two shots and going for the third tomorrow (5th March 20). All my scalp got cleared two weeks after the first injection and most of the other plaques on other parts of the body are getting cleared now. At least no flaking from the spots.  Though I still have some joint pains especially during early morning."
644,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,8,I've had psoriasis for 48yrs. I had my 3rd shot a few weeks ago. My psoriasis have cleared up 85% and helping Arthritis. I had tried everything you could think of. I'm glad my Dermatologist suggested this to me.

646,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,10,"I was 65 when I got psoriasis, tried everything possible until I told my derm. I have to have something. I have received 2 inj. & feel it has pretty much saved my life (not really) but I'm so much more comfortable. However I retired in Jan. & my ins. changed to Humana which will not cover Stelara, so at this time I am stressing (worst thing you can do) about how I can continue this inj. without having to pay the enormous price, so I am researching everything possible...long story short I have definitely benefited from the Stelara..."
647,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,7,I have Crohn's disease and was put on remicade to treat it and then I developed medical induced psoriasis it's so bad and painful I can't walk some days and I have a hard time opening things like doors. All of hair fell out and be a 24 year old girl I was devastated. I was put on stelara at an abnormally high dose of 90mg 1 a month for a few months now I'm at 6 weeks the goal is to get me to 8 weeks stelara has made an improvement my hair has started to grow back in and right after the shot I can walk and my hands start to heal but within a couple of weeks I back slide again but stelara has really helped me not lose my mind completely if I was a normal psoriasis person maybe it would be better.
648,For Crohn's Disease,10,"I was diagnosed with crohn’s disease at age 22; I am currently 34. For 10 years my disease was unmanageable, and I suffered a great deal. I have tried every biologic, and every Crohn’s medication with no luck. Two years ago I began using Stelara, and this drug has saved my life and offered me a shot at remission. I did still flare for the first six months, but I have basically achieved a full remission. During my remission on Stelara  I was able to carry to term my first pregnancy; a true miracle that wouldn’t have been possible without this medication.  I decided to withhold my injection in the third trimester, and postpartum so I could breast feed. I am one and a half months postpartum, and I am developing a flare up so I will resume my injection. Me and baby are both healthy so far. I wanted to share my story because I know that I wasn’t able to find a similar account when I was looking for answers."
649,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,9,"18 yr old college student here! I was diagnosed with psoriasis a little over a year ago. I got my wisdom teeth out in March of 2018, and after 3 weeks, 85% of my body was covered in severe psoriasis. I used diet change, topical ointments and creams, phototherapy, cyclosporine, Humira, and Stelara. I built up autoantibodies to Humira so I had to switch medications and who was the lucky winner??! You guessed it. STELARA! I have been experiencing joint pain recently but my skin is 99% clear now after taking my first dose of Stelara this January. I took my third dose 3 days ago and my life has completely changed. I can actually focus on my studies while feeling healthy and happy in my own skin.

Thank you, Stelara. You are giving me the chance to live out my college years to their fullest. 

I gave it a 9/10 rating because it was a NIGHTMARE trying to get my Stelara ordered to the package center at my college dorms."
650,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,9,"Had a mild case of Psoriasis - just one patch and some dandruff scales. Had Psoriatic arthritis for about two years -  morning stiffness, swollen small joints and knee pains - I endured these for almost two years. 

On Doctor's advice started Stelara. After the started dosage, she also prescribed Remicaid for a few weeks. However, it took almost a week for my Pharmacy to fill Remicaid.

Within 3-4 days of taking this medicine, I felt better slightly and stopped my daily Celebrex. And when my Pharmacy called me to pick-up Remicaid, I said I don't need it! Within two weeks I could feel better enough to stop Celebrex. 

I took my second shot about 6 weeks ago. At this point my joint pains are 90% gone. I am almost back to normal. I am able to wear my wedding ring that I removed before finger stared swelling.

I am back to going to Gym - build my muscles back up. Life is good!

651,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,10,"I am 38 and have had psoriasis all my life. I have used everything I could get my hands on and only had brief relief over the years. I started Stelara in March 2011 and 3 weeks after my first shot I was 100% clear. I just took my 3rd shot and I am still 100% clear. If anyone has the facility to try this they should, this medicine really works. Thanks to the creators of Stelara, I wish I had started it before. I go everywhere I possible can without a shirt now..yeah!"
652,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,10,"What a life changer! I started Stelara 2 months ago.  It took about a month for me to start seeing some relief and now at the end of my second month, no more itching, redness,  and almost all of the psoriasis is gone. I only wish I had started this sooner! Make sure you check out the patient assistance card that can be used in conjunction with your medical insurance."
653,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,1,"I just lost my best friend to Stelara, yes it cleared her psoriasis up but she got severe lung problems last year and was put in ICU in Feb 2108  and then started having strokes 5 wks ago. We lost her Saturday night. She started seeing different symptoms a year ago.  I told her  and she said oh no its not the shot. I think it was - this stuff is poison"
654,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,9,I had psoriasis really bad that covered 80 percent of my body. Tried creams ointments and humira which helped clear some of it but then I tried Stelara for past two years and am now 99% clear with no side effects!
655,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,8,I have had psoriatic arthritis for 20 years. Mostly attempting to control the arthritis which at times has been debilitating to say the least. For the first year my skin was clear after the loading doses. I wore shorts and went swimming without fear! And while I'm still very happy with stelara I've noticed it doesn't control my arthritis as well (still manageable) and I have small patches beginning to appear. I'm well under the 200lb weight for the higher dose.
656,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,2,"I have had psoriatic arthritis for the past 12 years every treatment failed on me including photo therapy, humira, enbrel, etc.  I was covered approximately 70% and completely covered on my face and head.  I tried stelara and after 6 months got decent clearance I could see my face again.  I am at one year now and at month 10 it just failed hard,  I right back where I started.  I can just shake my head, hair, and face over a sink and completely cover it scales, chunks, paste, and slough from my psoriasis.  I very frustrated .  No one should have to live through this.  I haven't been on a date in over a decade.  No one even talks to me, I am in complete isolation. I hate stelara because it gave me hope"
657,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,,"I have psoriatic arthritis. I took my first shot on 5/26/10 and so far I am really pleased with the results. I take my second shot on 6/22/10. I was on humira for 10 months. Then it quit working. My body was 80% covered and I was miserable. Now my body is almost back to normal. The only side effect I had was insomnia and was tired for the first 10 days, then it went away. Hope it continues to work. Will keep you up to date after this shot."
658,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,9,"27 year old female. Suffered with plaque psoriasis since age 12 (15 years) just woke up covered from head to toe one morning. Tried every treatment avail in Canada- nothing worked. Parents went on a year hunt for a cure the first year I had psoriasis,  but turned up with nothing that remotely worked.
Two years ago I was prescribed Stelara , best decision I ever made. Price is insanely high but with the right teams amazing coverage became available. So far no noticeable side effects other than my common cold lasting longer than usual. Blood work and tests always come out fine.
Only problem I have had while on this medication is I was diagnosed with strep throat and because of that my psoriasis came back very drastically and over night."
659,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,7,I had never had psoriasis until age 50 it came on all of a sudden pretty much all over my body and nothing worked to get rid of it. I started the Stelara injections 10-7-13 and was amazed at how it cleared. I also was using the vitamin d cream at night. Just had my second injection 11-7-13 yet this time it did not work near as well.  The psoriasis is back and getting as bad as it was prior to the first shot.  It's a bummer because the next injection won't be for 3 months. Just so happens had my yearly blood work 10-14 and my cholesterol was 280/170 it has never been that high. I am also a breast cancer survivor and remembered the first time to have them inject my right arm as I had lymph nodes removed from the left side wonder if thatmatter
660,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,10,Suffered throughout my entire childhood with severe scalp and guttate psoriasis with even the strongest topical steroids having little to no effect. Stelara cleared my skin in a month and I've had zero side effects and only minor flare ups when I get stressed out with college.
661,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,9,"45 years with psoriasis. Tried everything - no luck.  On Stelara for three years now. WONDERFUL experience. Only side effect is I am always tired, but I can live with that as I no longer have ANY symptoms.  Wonderful medicine but VERY expensive. This would be the LAST medicine I would give up if I had to give up my meds."
662,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,1,"I took Stelara shots in June and July 2018. I am 64 years old & psoriasis for 13 years. 
In Hospital end of July with pulmonary embolisms both lungs & blockage. They thought I was going to die. 
It was not worth trying and I believe that physicians should evaluate better the age and shape the patient is in before prescribing. 
I take full responsibility for taking the drug but I am not a physician."
663,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,8,"I have had psoriasis since 1978. I had tried just about everything when my dermatologist suggested I take part in the study for a new drug, eventually called Stalara. It worked about 80% and left only two patches of itchy plaque - It has not increased (or decreased) since then. I went off of it (would not sign the papers to put my information in the cloud) in June of last year (2015). 

Surprisingly, it has not returned any worse in the 7 months I have been off of the drug. The two patches remain the same and all other body parts remain free of plaque. I'm feeling pretty good about that - I hope it continues."
664,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,9,"I've had moderate Psoriasis for the last 50 years! I'm 60 year old male and the first red patch of Psoriasis  appeared on my chest when I was around 10. 

Since then I have used mainly topical ointments and creams for patches on my legs, back, elbows and scalp with little relief. In fact, as I got older, my Psoriasis became rather worse.

In 2012, I started using Humira which helped with about a maximum 75% success rate in clearing the plaques. It never totally cleared my Psoriasis. But - it stopped its effectiveness around 2016. 
I have now been on Stelara for the past 2 years and am about 99.5% clear! I really like it as I have not been this Psoriasis free.......well..., ever!

Unfortunately, the Psoriasis has also taken its toll on my joints and I suffer from arthritis pretty much everywhere. So far, I am not sure if Stelara has helped with that, but I'm happy it has helped with the plaque Psoriasis.
Hey, life is only hard the first 100 years....so let's move it along."
665,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,1,"After the load Stelara shots and before the first maintenance dose my psoriasis cleared up almost completely,  then it stopped working,  I now also  feel lethargic and am depressed,  crying for no reason, I will be trying something else more targeted for psoriasis,  there have been a lot of new products coming out now, some of them are just for psoriasis.  I am glad I gave it a try though"
666,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,10,"I had my first Stelara injection 2 months ago (and a booster 30 days ago). The difference is amazing, I have no more flakes, the redness is during to pink. I can wear shorts in public and not be embarrassed. NO side effects at all! This is a fantastic drug."
667,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,9,I'm 38 ive been on stelara for 6 years and I was 80 % covered. within 6 months I was 95% clear. the only draw back is it doesn't work on my scalp and my fatigue over the years has gotten worse. some days I don't even want to move.
668,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,8,"I'm 26 and was diagnosed with Psoriasis about 5 yrs ago. I have Psorisis ALL over. I've tried everything from topical ointments  to PUVA light treatments. The lights helped externally but with Psoriasis, we need help from the inside out. I've tried Enbrel and Humira. I've been on a waiting list for Stelara. I FINALLY have recieved my first shot last week and this is AMAZING.  Within this one week, all of the flakiness is gone and my patches are reduced to a soft pink flesh color and are no longer warm to the touch.  I can tell it's slowly working and cannot wait for my next shot. The only side effect that hit me was an upper respiratory infection which included coughing and sore throat and only lasted a week. "
669,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,8,Stelara has lowered all the inflammatory  markers in my bloods to within a normal range. This however doesn't repair damage already done. I am however suffering much less of burning in the joints. The aching is still pretty much the same. I was previously on Embrel and have been on Stelara for only two months so a way to go yet. SO far so good.
670,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Plaque Psoriasis,10,I suddenly had Plaque Psoriasis show up at age 56 ( male ) with no general history of skin conditions before . Within one year the Plaque Psoriasis had expanded to 40% of my body . Within 1 month of the first injections I was on the way to clear skin . I have been clear skin for the past 4 years now . No side effects that I am aware off. For me it has been like MAGIC -- amazing .
671,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,10,"Unbelievable that this can be true! My last escalations were particularly ugly and all over my body. I was getting very depressed  as the other treatments did nothing to help. Winter was ending and you can't cover up forever. I have had this  heinous disease for 35 years.  

I am now on this for 9 months (1st shot, booster shot, then 2 more).  I am 100% cleared!!!!  Beaches, swimming pools, short sleeves!!!  I pray it keeps working : )"
672,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,10,"My psoriasis was so bad. Angry red, layers upon layers of scaling on both legs, elbows, even the groin area sometimes. I've been on so many medications for so many years I've lost count. Stelara is a miracle drug for me. After the first shot, within those first 30 days my scaling was 99.9% GONE!! It's been over a week since the second shot and my skin looks amazing. I can't say enough good things about this medication. I don't have to wear jeans and long sleeves in 90 degrees heat this summer! Thank you so much Stelara!"
673,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,10,"I'm 61 and have had psoriasis since I was 16.  Of all the medicines I have tried (MTX, Enbrel, Raptive, Cyclosporine, Humira) this is the best in terms of effectiveness and side affects.  I'm about 90% clear and have no side effects."
674,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,9,"After my first initial starter dose my my affected areas (back, rear end, hips, front legs, hair line, and behind the ears) were almost totally clear. After my next shot to present my skin is totally clear. I only have one issue (possible side effect), raising LDL (bad) cholesterol. My Dr. did not think it was the cause. Had a regular liver enzyme test ordered by Dr. I used another facility for the labs as I have no insurance. This test came with a full liver profile and my total cholesterol was 350. It's never been over 220 and that's when I drank, smoked, overweight, and ate terrible. All of those are now null. We tested it again a week later and it was 344. I waited 2.5 months and retested and it was 285. Nothing has changed, except time."
675,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Crohn's Disease,1,"I've had Crohn's for 30 years.  Tried Remicade, Humira, now Stelara.  The only thing it's doing is worsening my diarrhea.  Not helping the Crohn's, but day of treatment and for weeks after, diarrhea is greatly increased.  No other effects.  Would be a great medication for those with chronic constipation!"
676,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,8,"Stelara very effective, have been on it for 3 years and can lengthen time between injections i.e. 16 weeks without too much flare up. Have experienced chronic rhinitis and symptoms of depression as side effects."
677,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,10,"I have had horrible psoriasis since the age of 20. Even as a kid I had a flakey scalp that was embarrassing. Stelara for me feels like a miracle. I have been on Enbrel, cyclosporine, and I've used all of the steroids. I've used the Pagano diet which is very difficult. Stelara is great. When I combined UVB lights at the doctors office with Stelara my skin cleared up 100 percent in about 3 and a half weeks. My scalp even cleared up. This is the only medicine that works that I've used. The blood tests to stay on the medication are expensive and sadly many insurance companies won't pay for this. I hope that changes. I was so sick I could not work and got Stelara through charity for 1 year. It is amazing. "
678,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,9,I have both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. I have been dealing with psoriasis for over 20yrs all over my body and head ...always embarrassed and having to wear long sleeved shirts. Those of you that are still looking for something Stelara is worth trying. I love it after trying several other medications this is so far the best. I have found and it helps with both. I haven't had any side effects either. I have a 3yr old and I can finally take him to the park alone.
679,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,9,"Severe psoriasis for 36 years. Progressed into psoriatic arthritis. 90% of body covered.

That disease was ravishing my body, first time in 35 years I feel better mentally and physically. Truly amazing."
680,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,10,I have had memory problems for several years. I have been on the same medication for mental issues at least 2 years.  I received my 1st shot of Stelara and it has been 3 weeks ago. I just wondered if this medication has been tested for other uses besides psoriasis? My memory is slowly coming back to me. And I would like to know if this could be due to Stelara? I Love this change in me and I think it's from the Stelara not to mention my psoriasis is great- in the week all my white scales went away.  Thanks
681,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriatic Arthritis,4,Hello I am 59 year old women who has psoriatic arthritis for over 7 years now. I was on remecade and decided to try something else so my RMD put me on stelara. So here's the thing although my psoriasis cleared up my arthritis is bad I've only been on it for 2 months so I am giving it more of a chance. Anyone else here have arthritis and on stelara? Thoughts please and thank you
682,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,,"I am 27 years old and have psoriasis since 15. I have tried all ointments, sunbeds and every tablet.... Yes every tablet. I have just been put on stelara and had my first injection on Friday. Injection was pain free and very quick. I can honestly say I have had.no reductions in the psoriasis but it seems that my itching has completely stopped. I find my self scratching out of habit and I don't need to. Fingers crossed for this because if this doesn't work I don't no what next :-("
683,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,9,"Hello everyone and warm thanks for all extremely helpful comments!
I received my second Stellar injection about one month ago, an phased out the cyclosporine one week ago. The skin is incredibly clear of spots (since 25 years it has not been this good), but as a change, an almost intolerable itching started. 

a) Would anyone have experience how to calm down the itching? 

Taking sodium bicarbonate with water seems to help a bit, but I am still scratching in my sleep.  I have allergies, and thought that maybe antihistamine could work.

Thanks in advance for any hints you may have!"
684,Stelara (ustekinumab) for Psoriasis,10,"I just started  Stelara 5 weeks ago. It is amazing! I had plaque psoriasis all over my body (50%). 98% of the Psoriasis is GONE. I only have some small spots left on my elbows and knees where it was really thick and crusted. I don't have dandruff anymore. I can wear shorts and short shirts now. This is awesome! So far, no side effects.  I am so grateful to the folks who made Stelara. Check with your insurance. I was thinking it would be too expensive, but when I checked, my insurance covered most of it. You have to work with Specialty Pharmacies to get it in my experience. Most Pharmacies have them, but there is usually only 1 location where it is."
685,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,10,"I have had 81 infusions. I have tried all other injectable multiple sclerosis medications without much success. Although the PML is in the back of my mind, I keep plugging away every month. I have a wife and four children and a safety sensitive job. I function just like any other 43 year old man (playing golf, mowing my own yard, etc). I really don't think it would be possible without Tysabri. For me and my family, we feel that it is worth the risk. I am JC virus positive also."
686,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,6,"Avonex stopped working for my mom around 2006, and her quality of life was quickly deteriorating. She was using a walker and her neurologist suggested Tysabri. After discussing the severe and rare side effects, such as Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML), she and my stepfather decided to go for it. She took Tysabri for just over 4 years before we started noticing signs of decline in speech and motor function. In January 2011, it was confirmed she had PML. The doctors told us she had 3 weeks to 3 months, but we had her for 8 months (and one more birthday) before she passed away in October 2011 at the age of 53. Tysabri gave her a better quality of life for longer than she could have hoped without it."
687,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,1,"My daughter took Tysabri and got both IRIS and PML. She never took any other immune suppressant drugs.
Tysabri gave her aphasia, delusions leading to hallucinations, intermittent blindness, non-stop epilepsy, then grand mals, inability to digest food, projectile vomiting, muscular degeneration, blood brain clots and a stroke causing paralysis of her right side. After this disastrous suffering for over a year, her death."
688,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,10,"I was diagnosed with MS in 96 and was put on Betaseron.  Moved on from that to Avonex, Rebif, Copaxone, and Avonex again.  In 2010, I experienced a severe flare up involving complete paralysis on my right side.  Obviously the Avonex was doing nothing and my neurologist suggested Tysabri.   At that point, I really didn't care about the side effects.  All I wanted was some semblance of my life back.  As it turned out, Tysabri is and was a miracle drug.  I regained the use of my right side, was able to return to work as a state trooper, and eventually retire."
689,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,10,"I was 41 when I was diagnosed in 4/98 and took Copaxone until 9/99. I was one of the lab rats in the original Tysabri trials.  Then the FDA approved it and removed from the market due to PML.  My MS came with a back with a vengeance & I was still on Copaxone.  I got back on Tysabri in 4/07. I am almost 56 now and still working full time. I still go to the gym relatively regularly and lead a good life. If your immune system is okay other than MS, have not taken any nasty immune suppressing medicines and if they test you and you do not have the JC virus its a no brainer.  If you have the JC virus its more complicated.  My MS is still not easy but its my best option. Look at the stats vs. other options.  Good Luck!"
690,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,10,"Diagnosed 2010 (age 24), monthly flares for nearly a year. Luckily after every relapse I bounced back to normal with no lasting symptoms however the constant hospitalization wrecked havoc with my life. Copaxone and Avonex didn't work as well, JC negative so was put onto Tysabri 2 years ago without a single relapse. Back to pre-diagnosis feeling. Best medicine ever."
691,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,10,"I was first diagnosed with MS in 2006. I have tried Rebif, Betaseron, Copaxone, Avonex & lastly Cytoxen (which is chemo). I am now 47. I have been on Tysabri for 6 years. Tysabri has quite literally saved my life. My peripheral vision is gone due to prior MS flares, but my flares are non-existent now. Since I have been on the drug so long my greatest side effect of infusion seems to be fatigue for a day or 2 after infusion. During infusion I am also given IV Benadryl & anti-nausea medication. 
My MRI's have come back clean...no demyelination. If previous MRI's and spinal taps did not show positive proof of disease I would like to believe I was cured.
I do have neuropathy. I don't walk as fast as most and I jumble words. I am JC NEG"
692,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,1,"I took Tysabri for about 4 1/2 years and had no problem.  My biggest complaint was that it made my hair thin and fall out.  But, my feelings have completely changed.  The reason I originally went off of Tysabri was to try to have a baby.  Now that I know what I know, I would have stopped using Tysabri as soon as possible.  I am 35 years old and have to have a total hip replacement because of taking Tysabri.  A side effect of Tysabri is Avascular necrosis, which killed the top of my femor bone.  So, now I have to have a total hip replacement. This is absolutely horrible for me because I am such an active person who loves working out.  I will have a hard time going back on any drug after this."
693,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,10,"I used to have about 3 MS flare ups and year, and had to be on steroids all the time, while taking other MS shots, that made me very sick. I have not had a single flare up, or taken any steroids or any other meds since starting Tysabri almost 5 years ago. Also no side effects at all. I even teach zumba classes now. Sometimes only hours after my infusion. It has truly changed my life."
694,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,10,"My Multiple Sclerosis treatment: 9 years in a nutshell:
Copaxone = no real side effects, no real benefits.
Rebif = craptacular side effects, no real benefits.
Tysabri = no serious side effects (the odd urianary tract infection, drowsy after infusions), ZERO relapses since I started it in April 2012 (previously had been relapsing every six months).
 
Tysabri is AWESOME!"
695,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,10,"I was diagnosed with MS is 2014 not long after I had optic neuritis in my left eye.  The neuro opthamogist misdiagnosed the optic neuritis as a mini stroke.  So sad too bad but you are blind in your left eye.  It took a hospital stay of a week before a neurologist finally got suspicious and ordered several tests, mostly MRIs and a spinal test before confirmed.  The problem was I was a 68 year old male, very fit from playing tennis 4 days a week and working as a pilot.  I was on two medications, copaxone followed by techfadera .  I failed on both as I had more symptoms and more lesions on the brain.  i am now on tysabri , am positive for the JC virus , monitored but doing tremendous.  A wonder drug.  I prefer quality of life versus quantity."
696,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,10,"I was diagnosed with RRMS in Nov 2008 (age 16). I started out with Rebif and took that for a 2 years. I found that to be too painful so I stopped taking and medication all together. In May 2012 I tried gilenya, I was on that for about 4 months in which I had 5 relapses in those 4 months. My neuro decided to have me try Tysabri. I have been on it for 3 years and next month it will be 3 years since I have had a relapse. I do feel tired and dizzy when it is hot out though."
697,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,3,"I am on my third dose of Tysabri. I did poorly on Avonex, and my neurologist has been hesitant to place me on the other Multiple Sclerosis medicines due to the serious side effects of the Avonex. I developed sepsis 10 times in 2 years. So when I was admitted to the hospital and transferred to ICU twice in 2 months due to MS we decided to try Tysabri. The side effects have been difficult to say the least. Terrible urinary tract infections, headaches, ringing of the ears, anxiety, and depression. I am JCV positive so in fairness the anxiety may be due to fear of the PML virus. I am scheduled to have lab work after the next infusion and will make a decision on continuing therapy."
698,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,10,"I have been on Tysabri since 2007. I haven't had a single relapse. MRIs are good, symptoms are minimal or nonexistent, whereas before it was relapse after relapse. I was on Copaxone for a year before Tysabri was returned to market and it did nothing for me. I am negative JCV antibodies. I go in to the infusion center every 28 days, have an infusion for an hour, wait for the hour of observation and off I go. No side effects noted during my treatment with this medication. It's not for everyone but it works very well for me."
699,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,1,"Hell.They won't tell you about the risk of ""rebound effect"" until after you tell them you want to quit.Oh yeah, I'm constantly getting checked for HPV, even though I was vaccinated against it and have been testing negative (for HPV) for over 5 yrs. but thats the least of your worries compared to what else it does to your immune system. They want to have you on it until (if your lucky) you test positive for the JC virus,and take u off ASAP.Otherwise, you'll go unnoticed and risk a brain infection, but it gets worse, they've implied that even while testing negative for the JC virus you could still wind up with ""pml? Pll?"" ( I forget the acronym) but in short your actually risking your life or have ""permanent disability""from this horrible drug"
700,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,10,"I was dignosed in 2004 with RRMS. After several tries with meds, tysabri was the best. I have been on it now since 2008. MRI comes back no progression lesions seem to be shrinking. I love tysabri it does however make me more fatigue for up to two days after infusion and for the week prior to infusion."
701,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,7,"I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2007, 5 days after my 23rd birthday. For the first year I took Copaxone, and it did absolutely nothing for me. Then, since my MS was so aggressive, my doctors chose Tysabri for me. I have loved every minute of being on the medication. Not only have I been stable for 4 years, but my old lesions have shrunk in size. Unfortunately, due to being on the mediation for so long and coming back with a positive JC Virus test I am being taken off the medication which scares me to death. My advice to anyone considering the wonderful medication is that you have a serious conversation about the possibility of PML while on the medication. It's a choice of life or death. 1 in 250 people on Tysabri with a positive test are at risk."
702,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,8,"I am 24 years old and have been on Tysabri for about a year, after Rebif did not work for me. I have zero symptoms while on Tysabri. Infusion is easy and only once a month, and I went LESION FREE while on it! The ONLY reason it's not a 10 is because of the black box label for PML. This was such a stresser for me even though I was JC negative...until now. I am going off of it because I am now positive and will be switching to a new medicine, which I'm still debating on. Overall I say if you're JC negative, it is an amazing medicine."
703,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,10,I have been on only 3 types of medications for MS and this (Tysabri) is the best of the 3. I have been on it since June 2010 and have had no ill side effects! I started this medication with a different Dr but once I became JC positive he wanted me to switch to a different medication. I was not happy with the choices he gave me and he was very adamant that I needed to change medications.  I did some research about another MS Clinic and made an appointment there. My Dr now is still very careful with me and keeps taking blood tests every 3 months to monitor my JC number. Last month my number was .65 and as long as it stays below 1.5 he is Ok with me taking it. This medication makes me able to be my husband care taker!
704,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,1,"After 5 infusions, I have developed nucleated red blood cells. I am now waiting to hear what the neurologist has to say, but as this is a rare but documented side effect, I am done with Tysabri. This was my first medication, and I am loath to try another. Quality of life has got to be a better option than all of these chemicals that will just make me sick."
705,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,10,I have just had my second infusion and from the first I could see improvements to my balance and to my thinking. I only hope they can come up with something that is just as good as Tysabri without the risks of PML. I am a JC virus positive and I heard that after 2 years your risks of PML increase. 
706,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,10,"I've been on Tysabri for about 7 years. LOVE, LOVE LOVE this drug! I tried Avonex initially...I learned interferons and I don't get along well! Then Betaseron and Copaxone. Not strong enough. Tried Gilenya...always felt bad on it. Finally settled on Tysabri. Best decision ever! I have no side effects other than about a week before another infusion, I slow down...becoming more symptomatic and cranky! I'm a Tysabri ""junkie!"""
707,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,1,"The worst drug on the planet after getting one infusion I started limping, after the second infusion I had to rest and lean against something after walking less than a block. I started having suicidal thoughts and my father has me on daily check ins. This medicine is the worst thing I’ve done.  I will never trust a doctor that suggests this drug and doesn’t believe my experience after several witness have commented upon my poor physical ability."
708,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,10,"I was diagnosed with RRMS 1992 while on deployment in Africa. Returned back to the states and had an MRI done to positively identify the MS. Done, was discharged from the Navy 1994. I then started Bataseron 1995 after having repeated relapses. Stayed with that for a few yeas then switched to Avonex, again stayed with that for a few years and switched to Rebif which was okay but began finding it hard to find inject points on my body. Then switched to Copaxone for a short time and it was determined that I was allergic to the drug so one more time. In 2008, I started Tysabri and am still on it. The infusions are not a big deal because I am self-employed. Do I feel like my old self, can%u2019t remember what that was like however I still Scuba dive,"
709,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,1,"I have had MS for 20 years. I have been on every medication around. About 10 years ago I started having some movement issues, but nothing noticeable. In November 2017 I felt I was getting worse walking. I went on Tysabri. At that time I was not using a cane but I was getting fatigued easily and noticed my walking was getting worse. After a year and two months on Tysabri I am much worse. I use my cane full time, I get fatigued easily and have seen NO benefit from Tysabri only negatives. My MRI came back with no new lesions, but I didn't have any new lesions the past few years anyway. I am going off this medication and will just work on my diet and exercise for now. I can't afford to get any worse or I will be in a scooter."
710,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,2,"I am 47 years old. I was diagnosed with MS in March 2013. Was started on Tysabri in August 2014 as I had a relapse while I was on gilenya in June 2014. The year I was on tysabri was the most awful year in my life. I had increasing fatigue, on & off weakness in my arms and my legs. Had pain in my knees which became severe and progressive  in the last 2 months. I have been off work for 2 months now, I only walk inside the house but rarely outside, I had to stay away from all social commitments in the last 2 months."
711,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,1,"I am 19 years old.  I was diagnosed with RRMS at the age of 15, in 2012. I started out on Rebif injections. I was on that for 6 months and had to stop due to anaphylactic shock. I had 3-4 flares and had to be treated by steroids. After, I started Copaxone and had 3-4 flares that caused a lot of damaged. I took this medication for 6 months and went into  anaphylactic. In June, I started  Tysabri. It took 6 months of fighting with my insurance to cover it. In the time being, I tested positive for JC virus. I had my 6th infusion Nov. 10, 2016. I can't emphasize and exaggerate enough how terrible I feel. I can barely move. I have severe chest pain and tightness. I'm so fatigued, I can't stay awake for more then a couple hours. I hate it."
712,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,10,"I was diagnosed in June 22, 2012.  Started Tysabri August, 2012. I have never taken any other disease modifying medicines. I am JC negative. MRI in July 2013 shows no new lesions, no active lesions. I have never had a side effect from Tysabri. When I was diagnosed, my right leg shook so badly, I could barely walk.  I have drop foot, and weakened thigh and hip flexor muscles.  These symptoms have improved slightly.  I do not know if it is due to Tysabri or just how my MS is presenting.  
I chose Tysabri because I fall into the optimum category...no other meds and JC neg."
713,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,10,"Tysabri has been a life send for me. I have been on it since 2009 and its now 2015. Was dignosed in 2004. We can count back now to where my symptoms were started when I was in 1st grade, so it has taken me a long time to get it under control, been thru lots if not all of the medications nothing worked but tysabri. My lesions on my brain are beginning to shrink."
714,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,3,"I just had my 4th infusion.  Since the previous one and this past one, I have been extremely fatigued.  Can't seem to do anything for any period of time.  Have trouble sleeping due to a strange feeling I get in my chest (feels like my pulse is jumping out of my chest, no pain, just a very weird feeling).  I was hoping this Tysabri was going to help me, but it hasn't. :("
715,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,8,"Just took my first does of Tysabri on 10-18-2013. Copazone stopped working after 5 years, Rebif did nothing to help. I tested positive for JC in February, then another doctor tested me in August and it was negative. So a third test showed inconclusive in Sept. Since I was on the decline I decided to take the infusion. I am 49 and want to live another 49 years. No real problems but my nerves. Slight itching the next morning and sore stomach. A lot less side effects than Rebif for sure! I worry about PML but I cannot change it. Praying for the best."
716,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,10,"Tysabri has changed my life. I have had 20 infusions now. At first I could feel a major ""up"" and then could slowly feel the medicine wearing off towards the end of the 28-day cycle. Now I don't feel much of an up or a down, but I feel consistent and ""normal"" again. I feel more level-headed, have consistent energy levels, and am able to work out at the gym two hours a day! The only side effect I've ever had was a bad headache on the evening of my infusion for the first 2 or 3 months. At my 6-month MRI/follow-up we found out that the Tysabri was actually causing a significant reduction in my lesions. I haven't had a relapse and only a handful of flare-ups (that last maybe an hour tops)."
717,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,10,Was diagnosed in 2009.  I was on Rebif for 2 1/2 years and had 2 relapses.  My doctor and I decided to switch to Tysabri which I have been taking for more than 4 years.  No relapses.  MS is stable.  I continue to test negative for JCV.  This medication is easy and successful for me.
718,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,10,"I have had multiple sclerosis for 12 years. Been on every medicine, steroids and the list goes on. 1 dose of tysabri. I'm walking 50% of the time without my walker (which I was using 100% of the time for the last 2 years). My mental and my balance have made a great recovery. I can't wait for my second dose!"
719,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,10,"In July of 2014, I was given the diagnosis of MS.  The medicine has worked well for me so far.  I have headaches after infusions, they don't last long. I take Cambia for the headaches. Tysabri helps me to walk, drive, travel, and keep my job. My dizzy spells don't happen as much.   Tysabri is the only medicine I've taken for MS.  I am still in shock from being diagnosed with this condition. I am very happy Tysabri,even with the risks of JCV and PML."
720,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,10,"I've been on tysabri since January 2008 and have not had any flair ups. It's even better that they can now test for the virus that causes the rare brain infection, which I don't carry. Benefit I like is its done every 28days so I don't worry about missing a dose or giving myself a shot. It usually takes about 3hours for the infusion. Only negative about tysabri is the cost. I'm on social security disability and after Medicare's payments I'm left with a bill for medicine and infusion of close to $1200 every 28days."
721,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,9,"My wife was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis 2 months after I asked her to marry me, at age 19. Her symptoms were pretty bad. She was on Copaxone for over a year. It really didn't do anything for her. Then she went to a few more doctors who all said she had a aggressive case of MS. Her new doctor put in on Tysabri. She did very well after a couple months. She never had a serious set back. Then when we found out she was pregnant she went off of her infusions. After our baby was born 7 weeks later she had the most aggressive set back with her MS. She couldn't even hold our son. She decided to stop breastfeeding and to go back on Tysabri infusions. 3 weeks later she was able to hold him and is doing a little better each week."
722,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,10,After being diagnosed with MS I started on rebif injections which I continued with for a year and a half. I spent six days of the week with flu like symptoms. To be on rebif I had to stop taking warfarin which I need to help with another condition. 7.5 years ago I was switched to tysabri so I could once again take warfarin at the same time. That was the best thing that happened. I'm no longer feeling dreadful for the majority of the week and in fact suffer no symptoms. I'm fortunate that I'm jc negative and that the government here covers the cost of my infusions and best of all had no flare ups since I started on tysabri.
723,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,6,"I first wrote a year ago. I am now thousands in debt due to the freq cut off of benefits from organizations that give grants. I am not informed when the cut off payments. So I owe thousands, why don't the infusion centers notify patients when they have no funding. I have had nothing but severe pain in my joints. Severe rashes, sores, etc. I can't stand how I feel. I was over $200,000 in ACTH this last year. How can I afford to raise my family when I am denied all help. Who is getting all this money. I have been a coma for over 8 times this last year. Twice on life support. 8 cases of sepsis. I have no family, just two handicap children that I adopted. I can't believe Drs would do this to patients."
724,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,10,"Tysabri is the first medication I was put on after being diagnosed with MS. So far it has been very effective, I started taking it after recovering from my first attack. I don't know if it is the Tysabri or just my body healing, but over the last 6 months I have continued to feel fewer and fewer MS symptoms. I was even able to run a marathon recently. 
I do treat positive for the JC virus antibodies, but my doctor had assured me that I can take Tysabri for up to two years with minimum risk of PML.
The injection typically takes 1 hour, with another hour of waiting (something the government had mandated for some reason or another), but I have not felt any side effects."
725,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,9,"I was diagnosed in 2010. Tried Copaxone & Avonex. They caused allergic reactions. Started Tysabri in March 2012. I haven't had any new lesions. I get tired and bad headaches after infusions. The cost is getting to be to much, even with my insurance from my employer & the assistance program from Tysabri. "
726,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,6,"I have been on Tysabri since Jan 2015. Every month, about 7 days before my next infusion, my body is completely ravished with joint pain, pain & fatigue in my arms and legs. I have a cob web feeling in my left shoulder blade and my hands remain numb. I have been forced to go to the ER because the pain was intolerable. A few times I made it to my infusion but couldn't walk and the pain was so great they had to give me Dilaudid before my infusion. It usually takes 3  days after the infusion for the pain to subside . Every single month I spend 10 days in hell, but I am blessed to get 20 days of normal life. The FDA needs to understand that this drug does not last 28 days, this should be a 21 day cycle, otherwise people suffer with this drug."
727,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,10,"I was on Tysabri for 103 Infusions, almost 8 1/2 years. I was diagnosed in 2002. Copaxone first with reactions, then used rebiff for 4 yrs. Helped alot while it was working, then it stopped in 2006. Started Tysabri. The Best MS Medicine! I Loved It! I am Going to Miss having No Symptoms, Side Effects or Flare Ups. I just talked with Doctor going to try Gilenya, in 2 Months after Solulmedule. Keep "
728,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,10,"I have to give it 10 out of 10, as it changed my life. After years of injecting other meds and continuing to relapse, I started on Tysabri in 2009. I can honestly say that I cannot work full time without it, as the fatigue is greatly improved whilst on it. I have come off to get pregnant, and then continued back on after two babies. My last MRI showed that some of my lesions actually got smaller, and I have not had any brain atrophy whilst being on this drug. The only side effect I notice is slightly thinner hair. This is a drug that can have serious implications, and I think the choice to take it must be thought carefully, weighing all the benefits and risks. But for me, it has saved my life for 7 years."
729,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,5,"Hi I am a 52 year old man who has had MS for about 18 years (SMPS) I'm on a lot of hormones for other problems which have helped masked the MS symptoms but not so any more, I'm now on Ty and have had 5 infusions and have not noticed any changes better or worse no side effects, I hope for a miracle but who knows, I'm JC neg and have a lot of trust in my Neurologist, lets all hope for a better tomorrow cost is 0 as Australia medicare pays"
730,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,9,Has anyone else experienced mental issues with this drug . I got severe anxiety and started feeling depressed after started this drug and some mental confusion. Other than this the drug seems to be working.
731,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,1,I have had M.S. before 2000 and they diagnosed me in 2000. I have tried all the other therapies and all of them had the really bad side effects but Tysabri it is the most relaxing drug you can take. I got a little nauseated at first but then it has disappeared with time. You don't even know it is working. I was considered a quadriplegic and now I can get around my home without lifts or anybody jerking or pulling on me. It is a great thing Tysabri. I just wish that everyone could benefit from it like me. Thank you.
732,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,9,"I was taken off tysabri when my original consultant left the hospital. After 5 years of better quality of life I now experience some nasty side effects after coming off the drug. Terrible rashes m.s symptoms returning ie dizziness, fatigue, coordination problems to name a few. Feel pretty rubbish to be honest. Consultant said couldnt justify script as scans had no changes. And was concerned about PML risk. I accept the risk, always have. Surely scans indicate drug doing what is expected? Am stuck now, what is available for me to try? Cost a big deciding factor!"
733,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,,"My husband has been on Tysabri for a year now. The first six months were great. He liked that he was had no nausea and could control bowels compared to Copaxone and Rebif. Fatigue improved. He had very slight improvements to his walking gait and balance. Mental attitude was improved. Lately, balance is poor, walking is dragging/carrying his leg forward, twitch and jerks are back. Strangers call him spider man in public (he laughs). Depression is setting in again. Hearing ringing sounds. "
734,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,7,"I have received 36 infusions and from the 1st one, my progression stopped. My major side effect is extreme confusion. I feel as if I am going insane and taking my husband of 28 years with me. He is my biggest supporter, my hero, etc. I do not know how I would have made it the past 3 years without him. He is my translator because I get so confused I tell stories totally wrong, I talk backwards. I skip every other sentence but the thing I must keep remembering is that my MRI's have not changed from the day I started Tysabri. I am staying with it for 12 more months and hopefully my wonderful husband, doctor and I will survive this."
735,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,10,"I've used Tysabri for past couple years. Prior to Tysabri, I used couple other drugs but nothing worked as well as Tysabri. My wish would be to take it every 21 days instead of 28 days. The 4-5 days before infusion time can be very painful with head & body aches accompanied by brain fog 
I don't understand the risks for a 21 day infusion, but I'm willing to learn"
736,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,3,I was diagnosed with ms in May 31 2016. First we wanted to do tecfadra but insurance wanted me to do something cheaper. In that time I had a horrible relapse. So we choose tysabri my doctor said it was the only other drug strong enough to deal with my ms. After my 4th infusion I tested JC positive and had to be hospitalized. I am no longer on it and I am not a fan of it
737,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,5,"Hi my beloved friends, 2 days ago I had my 16th tysabri, tell you what my walking is turned to baby steps with a cane, tired exhausted especially during hot weather, but 
I got diagnosed 2017 and I had no walking issues apart from my right eye that had a patchy feeling, now I have shoulder pain, left leg experience momental seizures  which I am controlling it with tegretol. Doctors are saying that I need to exercise but I can't as my feet are shivering and are too weak to pedal, thinking to move to ocrevus any idea."
738,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,8,"I've only had 2 infusions of Tysabri so far.  My Dr. is planning on keeping me on the drug for 12 months.  So far, the side effects are min.  a migraine headache and extremly tired.  BUT those I can certainely live with.  Within 1 day after infusion they are gone.  This drug so far is much better.  I seem to be feeling better both mentally and physically.  I wish this drug was the first drug that I would have been given 13 yrs ago -- maybe then I would not have been classified disabled and still be able to work."
739,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,9,"We found out my husband has MS a year after I had brain surgery for removing 80% of an Acoustic Neuroma Tumor. So, naturally we were devastated, AGAIN... since both our brains SUCK. He was on Copaxone for two years until he had a terrible relapse where he was totally paralyzed except his right hand and he had to be admitted into the hospital, go into rehab and come home in a hospital bed. This was when he started Tysabri, July 2011. Since then, he slowly came back from being bed ridden, to being in a wheelchair for months, to using a walker for months, then using a cane.  I believe Tysabri helped him come back to himself and his family, physically and mentally.  He had another relapse two years ago, only because he stopped taking Tysabri for a month to get tested for his JC virus. He has been on Tysabri for almost 8 years and his Dr plans to keep him on it unless his JC virus turns positive.  We love it."
740,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,7,"I failed Copaxone and then Avonex therapy. I started Tysabri in March of 2010. Some improvement in my disability. The only side effect that I get is a two day migraine post infusion. Otherwise, I do NOT miss the shots and flu symptoms. I actually look forward to the 2 hour nap during and after infusion! I recommend this medicine to those that fail on the other ABCs!"
741,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,6,I have been on this medication for just about a year and think it is wonderful the only issue is about a week before my infusion I have a real increase in symptoms I wish that there was a 21-day option because 28 is too far
742,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,9,"Have been on Tysabri for 39 months. For me, it has been life changing. I have been on it all in the last 11 yrs and nothing has worked for me like Tysabri I also experience post treatment headaches and prescription MIDRIN works great for the headache pain."
743,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,,"I was diagnosed with M.S almost 4 years ago and have been on Tysabri, and up until April of this year no problems. In April I was in the hospital 2 times. July I contracted Meningitis and was hospitalized for 8 days sent home with a picc line to infuse myself for 6 days. Then again in November I contracted Meningitis again stayed 6 days this time and came home with a picc again. This medication worked good with slowing down the progression of my lesions but it killed my immune system.  My doctor has taken me off the medication.  We will see what is gonna be her next move."
744,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,8,I've had  monthly Tysabri infusions and have been in remission for 9 years. I've had MS for 34 years. I became JCV positive and then converted back to negative. The only side effect has been some migraines and UTI's. It has been a miracle for me. I walk with a walker and use a power scooter for long distances.
745,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,7,"Before my treatment is due, I get so much pain in my shoulders, shoulder blades, arms and hips/leg. I also become really irritable, and erratic moods.  This happens about 1 to 1.5 weeks before its due. I have been wondering if tysabri is addictive because its like my body is screaming for it. According to my MRIs my legions are shrinking so its doing something in the background. However, I've either gotten worse since being on tysabri or its progression. MRIs say stable, go figure."
746,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,9,"I sometimes get a headache and some fatigue the day of and after the infusion, but this has done wonders in keeping my MS symptoms at bay. My lesions haven't been active for about a year now, which I believe is because of the Tysabri."
747,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,9,"I have used this medicine for two years and by far the best treatment for my multiple sclerosis. No side effects, and I don't have to take daily shots. I would recommend this to anyone who has multiple sclerosis.
"
748,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,10,I love Tysabri! Having been on it a year and a half it's a lot better than Avonex. No more flu-like symptoms! I just hate having to sit for an extra hour or so to be monitored. I recommend this when all else fails.
749,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,,"I was on Tysabri for about 18 months and after that I was on drug holiday for about one year. I restarted my infusion in March 2010 before drug holiday. I never experienced any side effects with Tysabri, however this time around I had muscle ache, fever and daily migraine headaches for 10 days so far, because I still have the headache. I hope I can tolerate this drug again because during my 1st trial I experienced all the positives i.e, balance, walking, thinking, fatigue improvement. I will give it another 2 infusions and wait to see if the side effects stop. Otherwise I may stop the treatment."
750,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,10,"Abdominal discomfort, gaseous and irritable stomach, eye allergy, headache, drowsiness, urinary frequency, mental issues. I have been on Tysabri 7 years, 16 with MS. It Keeps me stable for a long long time. Best treatment in my case.Hope you all are fine."
751,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,10,"I have had 8 infusions.  They help...I have mild headaches after each one, but a nap fixes that.  No issues.  I DO know that you have to stay in close contact with your doctor, monitor liver function and take care of yourself.

752,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,7,Have had 12 treatments so far for MS. Have experienced sometimes extreme tiredness following treatments. Have gained about 40lbs in the past year since starting the treatment with no significant changes in diet or exercise. On the good side am glad to not be taking daily injections anymore.
753,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,10,I have been on Tysabri for a couple of years. I see improvement with mo new lesions. As for many the week before the infusion it is like I crash. I hurt with low energy. I will take this compared to more disability. The brain infection chances are scary but living life to it's full potential is worth the risk.
754,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,4,"changing to ocrevus in 2 weeks after 12 tysabri's. I had relapse around 9th infusion. My bloods came back JC positive (was told negative initially), MRI had increased lesion load. Also found it never lasted the 4 weeks. The pain and fatigue came back about 10 days prior to next dose initially but that became longer to the extent iIwas lucky to have a few good days after dose."
755,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,9,"Copaxion was first medication for two years, after 2015 definitive diagnosis of MS, but had horrible injection site side effects and more lesions. The first two infusions I felt good and some of my symptoms had eased since I had a relapse while off meds. The fifth infusion I had chills and fever for a few days and that hasn’t happened again. The worst side effect experienced is tiredness for several days and sometimes chills. I use a cane from time to time for balance and weakness. I won’t know if Tysabri is working until February MRI, and am hopeful For no new lesions. This medication is better than all the horrible injections. I do get depression after as well, but take a low dose antidepressant, which has helped very much. I am JC negative. It is good to know after reading reviews that I am not the only one who experiences tiredness after infusions. My neurologist’s PA said she hasn’t heard of anyone with side effects."
756,For Multiple Sclerosis,10,"I am 26 and I was diagnosed with MS when I was 17. I had a heavy lesion load in my brain and spine when I was diagnosed, and was put on Rebif injections for several years. Rebif had an average-poor effect in managing my MS and I had terrible side effects such as extreme fatigue,  flu like joint pains and depressive mood. I was changed to Gilenya which was moderately better at controlling my relapses,  though they still happened regularly. Over 2 years ago I was put on Tysabri and I've never felt better. I haven't had a single relapse or symptom in that time. Some of my lesions are reducing in size,  and I have no side effects from the drug except minor fatigue a few days before my infusion. I am JC negative currently."
757,For Multiple Sclerosis,10,"I have been taking Tysabri for a decade and it has been a Godsend!!! My MRIs have shown improvement and the only side effect is that I become tired, an hour after the infusion, and stay low energy for the rest of that night.  The next day, though, I'm full of energy, steady on my feet and in a great mood! The week, before infusion, I start losing balance again, but that's the whole of it... until this month, when I tested JCV positive for the first time. I hope and pray that my doctor and I can find something that is equally effective and does not pose the same PML risk for JCV+ patients!!"
758,For Multiple Sclerosis,3,"I was on tysabri for 7 months.... I think, at first I would be extremely agitated, tired and weak, by around month 4 I started getting pain in the top of my right hip have never experienced pain so unbelievably intense,  if it was even just slightly touched I would drop to the ground in utter agony, I began to slur my words and became emotionally unstable.  Tysabri seems to give me a much larger amount of MS which is annoying because they told me it had the least side effects and was by far the most effective. Glad to hear it helps other sufferers though . It's under PBS in Australia so they would only sting me for $37.50 a treatment."
759,"Tysabri (natalizumab) for Crohn's Disease, Maintenance",3,"I accepted using tysabri then 5 days after infusion , I woke up with my right index finger swollen tender and weak.
In my eighty years never had any joint issue.

760,Tysabri (natalizumab) for Multiple Sclerosis,10,"I was diagnosed when I was 29, but I know I've had it since I was 23.  After using different therapies for years I was going downhill fast. I decided to start Tysabri.  I just had my 103rd infusion.  Not positive for the JC virus yet, which is tested monthly.  My liver function is good.  And, not only have I not had any relapses, I've also had lesions disappear!  I just wanted to share my miracle drug testimony of 8.5 years.  I cannot tell you how much it's changed my life!  I'm walking again and haven't had any occipital neuralgia.  I'm done adding symptoms of ms to my life.  I look forward to my to cocktails once a month!"
