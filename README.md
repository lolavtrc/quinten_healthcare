**Project**: Analysis of Medication Reviews for Intestinal Diseases

### Introduction

This project aims to extract essential insights from a dataset of consumer reviews about medications used to treat intestinal diseases, such as Crohn's disease and colitis, which often require long-term medication. The goal is to assist a pharmaceutical company in understanding how its products are perceived by consumers and in identifying potential side effects.

### Project Objectives

The key objectives of this project are as follows:
- **Data Preprocessing:** Preprocess the data by performing operations such as punctuation removal, converting text to lowercase, stop word removal, and creating new columns for useful information.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Conduct sentiment analysis to evaluate whether reviews are positive, neutral, or negative regarding the medications. This can help identify the overall consumer perception.
- **Information Extraction:** Extract key information regarding medication side effects, benefits, drawbacks, and other relevant details.
- **Data Visualization:** Create visualizations to illustrate and communicate effectivly the results of the analysis.
